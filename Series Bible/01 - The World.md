# The World of Astra's Plain

This document covers everything about the universe: its creation, its structure, the realms, the races, and the systems that govern it. Understand this, and you understand the stage on which the entire story plays out.

---

## Part 1: The Creation of Everything

### The Almighty One

Before anything existed, there was a single consciousness floating in an infinite void of nothing. He had no name — he would come to be known simply as **The Almighty One**.

He existed for **millions of years** completely alone. Eventually, he discovered that he had a power: **creation**. His ability is literally the generation of energy from nothing. Everything that exists — every soul, every star, every blade of grass — was made from energy he produced.

But his power has a critical limitation: **it is not infinite**. The more he creates, the slower his power regenerates. And crucially, **when energy embeds itself onto a soul, he can never reclaim it**. This means that over time, there can be more power distributed throughout the universe than the Almighty One holds within himself. Every being he creates makes him a little weaker.

### Terra — The First Love

His first creation was a being called **Terra** — a conscious entity, his companion in the void. He loved her deeply. She was the only other thing that existed.

But Terra was unhappy. She hated the emptiness, the nothing surrounding them. She wanted *more*. Eventually, in despair, **she destroyed herself**.

The Almighty One, desperate to save her, poured out his power in a single cataclysmic burst — and this created the **Big Bang**. The universe was born from his grief and desperation. He failed to save her.

He mourned for years. He tried multiple times to recreate her — but he'd used so much energy in the Big Bang that he either didn't have enough stored, or when he did, he couldn't get her right. Eventually, he gave up on recreating Terra and decided to create *beings* instead.

### The Almighty One's Creations (In Order)

| Attempt | What He Made | Where | Result |
|---------|-------------|-------|--------|
| 1st | Gods, Dragons, Devils | One shared realm | **Failed.** They constantly warred with each other. The realm was destroyed. Its corpse becomes the **Dead Realm**. |
| 2nd | Dinosaurs | A new realm(Terra) | **Failed.** He hated their lack of intelligence.(Destroyed) |
| 3rd | Humans | The **Terra Realm** (after his lost love) | **Promising but disappointing.** They warred too. |

After creating humans, the Almighty One went quiet. He separated the surviving gods, dragons, and devils into their own individual realms to stop the warring. He hid himself away and stopped intervening.

### The Embedded System

This is a fundamental law of the universe and crucial to understand:

When energy from the Almighty One **embeds onto a soul**, it becomes permanently bound to that being. The Almighty One can never reclaim it. This is how powers work — magical abilities are energy that has embedded onto a person's soul.

- Some beings are born with embedded energy (inherited from parents)
- Some are granted it (elevated to godhood)
- Some acquire it through external means (Zion drinking goddess blood)

**Embedded power is a cap, not a floor.** Every being has a fixed ceiling of embedded power — they can train to get closer to that ceiling, but they can never exceed it. Raw talent determines the cap; effort determines how close you get. Even modern-day humans have embedded power within their souls, but after the Almighty One's death and the disappearance of magic, they can no longer access it. The energy is there — dormant, untouchable.

**Astra's embedded power** is unique. Part of it comes from his biological father, the God of Foresight and Wisdom (giving him foresight abilities he doesn't discover until Book 4). But a significant portion of his embedded power is tied to his connection to the **Astral Plain** itself — he has an innate link to that spiritual dimension that no other being possesses. This is what ultimately allows him to become the core of Heaven.

The embedded system explains why the Almighty One grew weaker over time while his creations grew stronger. It's also why he created the failsafe known as **Rerium** — three immensely powerful beings whose purpose is to kill anyone whose power begins to rival his own.

### What Happens When the Almighty One Dies

In Book 3 (Season 3), Astra and Leo kill the Almighty One. The consequences are universe-changing:

- **No new energy can ever be created.** Energy can only be transferred, never made.
- This is literally why the real-world law of **conservation of energy** exists.
- Magic "disappears" over time because no new magical energy is being generated.
- The Terra Realm eventually becomes our modern Earth — a world without magic, where the stories of gods became myths, then religions, then were forgotten entirely.

## Part 2: The Realms

The universe contains several distinct realms, separated from each other but connected through various means (portals, Realm Stones, teleportation).

### The Godly Realm

The realm of angels and gods. A celestial expanse of divine beauty where the presence of the Almighty One is felt everywhere.

**Capital City: Corvaz**
A magnificent city of celestial architecture, with grand statues of angelic figures, structures made of Angelic Marble with golden accents, wide boulevards leading to grand plazas. Despite the warm climate, it's often cloaked in clouds. Rain is rare and considered a blessing.

**Key Regions:**
- **The Cloud Straights** — Where the major cities are, including Corvaz. Rich resources, fertile land, clouds provide cover from threats.
- **The Cloud Valleys** — Ethereal beauty and serene tranquility. Home to the city of Celestia, known for its celestial gardens.
- **Highlands Boast** — Rugged landscapes and breathtaking vistas. Home to Radiant Haven, a city of intellectual pursuit with towering libraries.
- **The Edge** — The most notorious area, where the clouds visibly fall into The Void, spanning hundreds of miles in a circle.
- **The Sacred Grove** — A place of pilgrimage where the veil between the Godly Realm and the Astral Plain is thinnest.

**Key Locations:**
- **The Palios Temple** — Where the Cleansing Pods are kept. Ray worked here monitoring and healing gods.
- **Corvaz** — The political and spiritual centre of the realm.

**Government:** Governed by the **Circle of Ten** — a council of ten powerful gods who rule in the Almighty One's name. There are **24 gods in total** within the Godly Realm. The other 14 gods who are *not* on the Circle of Ten do not support their rule — they resent the Circle's authority, disagree with their decisions, or simply refuse to be involved in politics. This silent opposition becomes significant later in the series.

**Race:** Primarily **Valerian Angels** — the angelic inhabitants.

### The Terra Realm

The realm of humans. Named by the Almighty One after his lost love, Terra. This is where the majority of the story takes place.

The Terra Realm has a mixed technology level — it is *not* a standard medieval fantasy world. Guns exist alongside swords. There are bounty hunter guilds, royal kingdoms, martial arts dojos, and criminal organisations. Think of it as a fantasy world with anachronistic technology, not unlike the *Fullmetal Alchemist* world.

**Key Kingdoms and Cities:**

- **Kilson** — A large, bustling kingdom with cobblestone streets and grand architecture. Ruled by King Alon and Queen Velera, with Prince Balavis as heir. The city is divided into 4 districts, each protected by the Enforcer system. Home to the Singhi Tournament, Shranota's Dojo, and the Temporal Library. Major setting for Sophia's, Futures', and Dark's arcs.

- **Solamina** — A kingdom ruled by Queen Angelina. Has a royal castle, city inns, and streets. Major setting for Book 2 (Season 2), where Astra falls in love with the Queen.

- **Ioawa** — A small, desolate desert town in the Casp Dried Plains. Harsh environment, sparse population. Home to the Bayleen Hunters guild.

- **Laofia** — Capital of the Casp Dried Plains region. Home to criminal Kingpin Xiomi.

- **Haall** — A neighbouring kingdom to Kilson, ruled by King Soaran with his guard Orion.

**Key Regions:**
- **Casp Dried Plains** — Desert region ruled by King Istaliaara. Contains Ioawa and Laofia.

### The Demonic Realm

The realm of demons and devils. Separated from the other realms after the initial shared-realm failure. Dark has demonic heritage through the Black Demon's curse, giving him a connection to this realm.

**Demons Cannot Bear Children — They Are Grown.**
This is one of the most important pieces of lore in the series. Long ago, there was a period of uneasy peace between the angels and the demons. The god **Tenlith** (one of The Original 5, the God of Chaos) despised this peace. To shatter it, he infiltrated the Demonic Realm, **killed one of the 12 Devils**, and then sacrificed his own power of curse — channelling it into an immense, irreversible curse that rendered all demons **incapable of bearing children**. No demon can conceive, carry, or birth offspring. The curse is permanent and affects the entire race.

**Dawn** (the strongest of The Original 5) was furious at Tenlith's treachery. She fought and **killed Tenlith** for what he had done. When Tenlith died, his floating swords each became a new god (Nova, Miiac, Qazar, and others).

The goddess **Ray** (one of The Original 5) found a workaround. She funnelled an immense amount of her own power into the **land of the Demonic Realm itself**, altering the soil and environment so that demons could **grow** their children using a mixture of blood. Demonic offspring are literally cultivated from the earth using blood from their would-be parents. This is why demons are "grown, not born."

**The 12 Devils:**
The Demonic Realm is divided into **12 regions of hell**, each ruled by one of the 12 Devils. A devil's title is determined by which region they control. Unlike gods, **devils gain power from staying within their dimension** — the longer a devil remains in the Demonic Realm, the more powerful they become. This is why the 12 Devils are so formidable; they have spent millennia in their own domain, accumulating power. Satan is one of the 12 Devils and is the father of Queen Angelina.

**Black Demons** are direct servants of the 12 Devils — elite demons who carry out the Devils' will. A Black Demon is the one who cursed Sforza's womb with demonic essence, creating Dark.

### The Draconic Realm

The realm of dragons. Also separated after the initial failure. Futures has dragon heritage through his father Dimitri (a Demi — half-angel, half-dragon), giving him a connection to dragonkind.

**The Elder Dragons:** The Draconic Realm is governed by the **Elder Dragons** — ancient, immensely powerful dragons who are the progenitors of all dragonkind. They are numbered by seniority and bloodline. Dimitri's mother comes from the **Elder 5 bloodline**, making Dimitri (and by extension Futures and Sophia) descendants of draconic royalty. Elder Dragons are a tier above ordinary dragons in every way — size, power, intelligence, and magical ability. A direct descendant of an Elder is significantly more powerful than a regular dragon, even if they are not an Elder themselves. The dragon that killed Ray, for example, was a direct descendant of an Elder — not an Elder itself, but physically devastating nonetheless.

### The Dead Realm

The Almighty One's first failed creation — the destroyed shared realm where gods, dragons, and devils warred. It became a lifeless, empty space.

**This is the most important realm in the entire series**, because in the finale (Book 4), Astra transforms the Dead Realm into **Heaven**:
- Sophia uses her Mist to make it beautiful
- But it needs a living core to sustain it
- Astra becomes that core — he IS the realm, but can never participate in it
- They name it **Heaven** — after the daughter Astra always wanted but will never have
- Every soul that dies in the universe eventually ends up here
- This is literally the Heaven of human religion

### The Astral Plain

A spiritual dimension where souls exist separately from their physical bodies. It appears as a flat, endless plain with a deep blue sky that has no visible end, covered by a thin layer of water across the entire floor. Souls appear as transparent versions of their living selves.

Souls can be forcibly sent here through abilities like Soul Separation. If you have enemies in the Astral Plain, you must fight them — and losing means death of your physical body too.

The Sacred Grove in the Godly Realm is where the veil between the physical world and the Astral Plain is thinnest.

When Astra becomes the core of Heaven, the Astral Plain becomes the gateway — all souls manifest through it. Astra acts as a filter, blocking any being with malicious intent.

### The Void

An endless expanse of nothing that borders the Godly Realm. Visible from The Edge, where clouds fall into it. Traitors and fallen angels are cast into it.

---

## Part 3: The Races

### Valerian Angels (Angels/Gods)

The divine inhabitants of the Godly Realm. They serve the Almighty One and follow strict divine laws. Gods are Valerian Angels who have achieved immense power and hold positions of authority.

**Key Divine Law — The Treason Law:** It is treason to shelter, aid, or side with a demon in any way. Violators are expected to eliminate any demonic presence, *even if it means killing their own child*. This is the law that condemns Sforza when she refuses to kill her unborn son Dark.

**How Gods Are Made:**

1. **Born Through Blood (Natural Birth)** — The primary way new gods come into existence. When two gods conceive a child, **both parents sacrifice a portion of their own embedded power** to form the child's soul. This is not a fixed amount — it varies wildly from birth to birth. Some children draw only a sliver of power, leaving the parents barely diminished. Others draw far more. In extremely rare cases, a child can draw so much power during conception that **it kills one or both parents**. There is no way to predict or control how much power a child will take; it is one of the few things in the universe that is genuinely random. In addition to the parental sacrifice, the child's soul also absorbs **a portion of ambient energy from the Almighty One** — residual creative power that permeates the atmosphere and the fabric of existence itself. This means every god born is partly made from their parents' power and partly from the Almighty One's lingering energy, further contributing to his gradual weakening over time. This dual source is why gods can be born with abilities neither parent possessed — the Almighty One's ambient energy can embed in unpredictable ways.

2. **From Tenlith's Swords** — When the god Tenlith was executed, his floating swords each became a new god (Nova, Miiac, Qazar, and others). Each sword carried a fragment of Tenlith's immense power, and when he died, that power crystallised into new divine beings.

3. **Granted Power (Elevation)** — Through absorbing one of Tenlith's remaining power swords, outsiders can be elevated to godhood. This is how **Eana** joined the Circle of Ten — she absorbed the Gravity Sword, and its embedded energy fused with her soul, transforming her into a full god.

### Demi

A rare hybrid race — beings with both angelic and dragon heritage. Because Valerian Angels and Dragons are separate races from separate realms, Demis are extremely unusual and face prejudice.

- **Dimitri** is a Demi (angel father from the Godly Realm, dragon mother from the Draconic Realm — specifically Elder 5 bloodline)
- **Futures** and **Sophia** are Demis by inheritance (their father Dimitri is a Demi, their mother Sforza is a Valerian Angel)

### Demons and Devils

Inhabitants of the Demonic Realm. Demons are **grown, not born** — Tenlith's ancient curse rendered them incapable of natural reproduction. They cultivate offspring from the earth using blood, thanks to Ray's intervention (see Demonic Realm section above). The 12 Devils are the supreme rulers, each governing one of the **12 regions of hell**. Devils grow stronger the longer they remain in their dimension. Black Demons are direct servants of the 12 Devils. Demons fought against the Valerian Angels in The Holy War.

- **Satan** is one of the 12 Devils and is the father of Queen Angelina

### Dragons

Powerful creatures from the Draconic Realm. Dimitri's mother is from dragon royalty (Elder 5 bloodline). When pushed to his limits, Futures can transform into a massive blue and black dragon — his Draconic heritage manifesting physically.

**Role in the Holy War:** Dragons were **neutral** in the conflict between angels and demons. They did not choose a side — they fought as **mercenaries**, hired by whoever paid them or whenever it served their interests. The dragon attack on Corvaz (the event that kills Ray) was not an act of war loyalty — the dragons were hired for that attack. Dragons fight for themselves, not for causes.

### Humans

The Almighty One's third creation, made after he gave up on recreating Terra. Inhabit the Terra Realm. They were "promising but disappointing" because they also warred.

**During the Holy War:** The Terra Realm was **completely ignored** by both sides. Humans were considered too weak to matter — their power levels were negligible compared to angels, demons, or dragons. No faction bothered to recruit, attack, or even acknowledge them during the conflict.

### Other Races

The Terra Realm is not inhabited solely by humans and dwarves. Standard fantasy races exist throughout the world — **goblins, giants**, and other creatures populate various regions. They are not central to Book 1's narrative but are part of the living world and may appear in background scenes, world-building details, or future books.

### Dwarves

One of the races inhabiting the Terra Realm. The **Onami Dwarves** are a notable tribe from Nobum Island, known for their blacksmithing. Lof and Hoe are twin blacksmiths who run the Lohoe Blacksmiths in Kilson and wield Sylian Hammers that allow teleportation.

### Crow Folk

A race of humanoid beings with crow-like features. Simon, Queen Angelina's personal knight, is a Crow Folk.

## Part 4: Power Systems & Magic

### How Magic Works

All magic is energy from the Almighty One that has **embedded** onto a soul. It can be inherited (parents pass it to children), granted (through divine elevation), or acquired (through consuming divine materials like goddess blood).

Magic is not academic or learned from books — it is an innate part of a being's soul. Training develops control and technique, but the raw power is either there or it isn't.

### Key Abilities Referenced in Book 1

| Ability | User(s) | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| **Mist** | Sforza, Sophia, Dark | Inherited from Sforza. Manipulation of a dark, ethereal mist. Can create walls, manipulate perceptions, control minds (when whispered from lips), obscure vision. Dark's version is tainted by his demonic heritage — darker, usable for combat and limited healing. |
| **Blue Lightning** | Dimitri, Futures | Inherited from Dimitri. Generation and control of blue-coloured lightning. Can enhance speed, be used offensively, and when Futures transforms, becomes a devastating breath weapon. |
| **Sealed Markings** | Astra | Markings on Astra's body that glow when he exerts power. They act as limiters. Yellow = low power. Orange = significantly more powerful, emits heat. Red = maximum, so hot that buildings melt. When all markings go out and burst back red, something fundamental has shifted. |
| **Astrical Aura** | Astra | A healing ability Astra didn't know he had. Slowly heals wounds, restores energy and motivation. Discovered when he instinctively saved the Bayleen Hunters from a collapsing building. |
| **Gravity Magic** | Zion | Acquired by drinking a vial of blood stolen from **Eana, the Goddess of Gravity** (stolen by Sforza). Can crush targets with gravitational pressure, force people to kneel, shape gravity into lines and specific shapes for precise attacks. Techniques include Gravitational Collapse and Gravitational Pull. |
| **Soul Separation** | Ishido Fuju | Separates a person's soul from their body, sending it to the Astral Plain. The soulless body collapses. If the soul is defeated in the Astral Plain, the person dies. Doesn't work on beings with multiple souls (Dark's demon took over when his soul was ejected). Can be used on self as a last resort — grants power from collected souls, white glowing eyes. |
| **Soul Manipulation** | Queen Angelina | Can perceive and interact with souls. Can see their state (shrouded, chained, corrupted). If she kills an entity, she can use their soul — but only if the soul consents. |
| **Teleportation** | Snide | Instant transport from one location to another. Can be tracked by opponents with enhanced perception. |
| **Enhancement** | Lacray | Enhances a target's physical, mental, and magical powers by 2-3 times. |

### The Enforcer System (Kilson)

Kilson is divided into 4 districts. Each has an Enforcer system to deal with threats:

| Rank | Description | Numbers |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **S-Class** | Rarely deployed, last resort | 8 total across all 4 districts |
| **A-Class** | Powerful fighters | ~20-25 total |
| **B-D Class** | Increasing numbers at lower ranks | Many |
| **E-F Class** | Handled by city guard | Numerous |

**Power scale:** Each level equals roughly 3 of the previous level (1 S-class ≈ 3 A-class fighters). Exception: **Ishido Fuju** (S-class, District 2) is the strongest S-class — equivalent to 10 A-class Enforcers.

### Sealed Markings — Astra's Power Progression

Astra's power is visually represented by glowing markings on his body:

| Level | Colour | Effect | Book Appearance |
|-------|--------|--------|-----------------|
| Base | Yellow | Standard combat power | Book 1 |
| Elevated | Orange | Significantly stronger, emits intense heat | Book 1 |
| Maximum | Red | Buildings melt from the heat, devastating power | Book 1 (briefly) |
| Angelic Form | — | Holy power unlocked | Book 2 |
| Demonic Form | — | Demonic power unlocked (was sealed by holy light) | Book 2 |
| Uncontrolled Form | — | Both holy and demonic, no control — berserk | Book 2 |
| True Form | — | Both combined, fully controlled | Book 2 |
| Fused Form | — | Combined with Leo, strongest being in existence | Book 3 |

## Part 5: Key Factions & Organisations

### The Circle of Ten

The governing council of 10 gods in Corvaz who rule the Godly Realm in the Almighty One's name. They enforce divine law and their decisions are considered absolute.

**Current Members (as of Book 1):**
Nova, Qazar, Miiac, Eana, Horizon, Elemental, Jupiter, Tone, Falic, Shade

**Former Members:**
- Ray (one of The Original 5, deceased)
- Sforza (condemned and exiled for carrying a demonic child)
- Dimitri (left to protect his family, deceased)

They are the primary antagonists of Book 2, when they demand Astra's death.

**Important:** By the end of Book 2, **all current members are dead**. Sophia replaces them as ruler of the gods.

### The Original 5

The first five gods ever created by the Almighty One. They are ancient and immensely powerful:

| God | Domain | Status | Notes |
|-----|--------|--------|-------|
| Ray | Blood/Life | Deceased (Book 1) | Astra's biological mother |
| Tenlith | Chaos | Deceased (executed by Dawn) | Cursed demons; his floating swords became gods when he died |
| Dawn | Raw Power | Alive | The strongest; defeated all 3 Rerium, killed 1; killed Tenlith |
| Gideon | Defense | Alive | Believes in divine order; sides with Circle of Ten |
| Varek | Attack | Deceased (Book 2) | Helped Ray create the Astra weapon; dies protecting Astra |

### Rerium — The Failsafe

Three extremely powerful entities created by the Almighty One to kill anyone who rivals his power. They don't actually care about their creator — they see themselves as the ultimate beings. They have a specific vendetta against Dawn.

Dawn defeated all 3 and killed 1. The remaining 2 face Astra in Book 3.

### The Oracle (Book 1 Villains)

A criminal cult in the Terra Realm led by Zion. Identified by a black and purple symbol.

**Members:**
- **Zion** (leader) — Gravity Magic, acquired through blood stolen from Eana, Goddess of Gravity (given by Sforza)
- **Oraylious** — Attacks Futures at the tournament
- **Baxter** — Daggers expert, the one who split up Sophia and Astra
- **Tailors** — Magnetic Pulsion
- **Horux** — The one who fought Astra; wears purple-plated armour with self-healing properties
- **Snide** — Teleportation
- **Lacray** — Enhancement (buffs allies 2-3x)
- **Dark** — Temporary/unwilling member

**All killed by end of Book 1** except Dark (who was never truly loyal to them).

### The Bayleen Hunters

A tight-knit bounty hunting guild based in Ioawa. They are Astra's found family in Book 1. Key members:

- **Janim** — Guild leader
- **Jack** — Seasoned hunter, family man, gun user. Teaches Astra about family and sacrifice.
- **Lacy** — Jack's wife
- **Millie** — Jack's young daughter
- **Blake** — Thoughtful hunter who has a philosophical conversation with Astra about emotions
- **Adam** — Friendly, upbeat hunter, gun user
- **Saphire** — Technician, uses gadgets and a Rocketeer
- **Mandy** — Emotional, fierce. Makes the killing shot on Horux.
- **Larson** — Mandy's emotional anchor
- **Elada** — Cooks for the guild

**Mostly massacred** by Kingpin Xiomi and Horux. Only Astra, Mandy, Larson, Adam, Saphire, and Millie survive.

### The Umbro

An elite team of soldiers within the kingdom of Kilson, conceived by Prince Balavis and built by Sophia. She selected and personally trained them using her Mist. They are fiercely loyal to her but unaware she has been subtly manipulating them.

### The Enforcers

Kilson's threat response system. See the power system section above for details.

### The Lements (Book 2)

The elite knight group of Solamina, serving under Queen Angelina. In order of strength: Rose (#1, dies Book 2), Denif (#2, survives), Gaia (#3, dies Book 2), Dan (#4, dies Book 2).

### The 12 Devils

The twelve most powerful demon lords in the Demonic Realm, each ruling one of the **12 regions of hell**. They gain power from remaining within their dimension — centuries of accumulated strength makes them formidable beyond measure. Satan is one of them and is Queen Angelina's father. A Black Demon (direct servant of the 12 Devils) is the one who cursed Sforza with Dark's demonic essence.

## Part 7: The Holy War (Background Conflict)

The Holy War is an ongoing conflict between the forces of the Godly Realm (Valerian Angels, led by the Circle of Ten) and the Demonic Realm (Demons, led by the 12 Devils and their servants including Black Demons).

It has shaped the political and social structure of the celestial realms for ages. The war is the backdrop to the opening of Book 1 — it's the reason Dimitri and Sforza are sent to the frontlines, which leads to Sforza being cursed with Dark's demonic essence, which triggers the family's exile.

**The Dragons fought as mercenaries** — they did not align with either side ideologically. Dragons were hired for specific operations (including the Corvaz attack that killed Ray) or fought when it directly benefited them. They had no stake in the angel-demon conflict.

**The Terra Realm was ignored entirely.** Humans were considered too weak and insignificant for either side to bother with. The war was fought between celestial beings; mortals were beneath notice.

There is also an ancient prophecy (discussed by Miiac and Ray) foretelling a *different* great war — separate from The Holy War. The implications of this prophecy are not fully explored in Book 1.

---

## Part 8: Materials, Weapons & Items of Note

### Notable Materials
- **Stamoid** — The most absorbent metal on the planet. Used in training (students must break a Stamoid block without breaking the wooden frame beneath) and weapon crafting (the Dargon Katana).
- **Angelic Marble** — The building material of Corvaz, gleaming with golden accents.

### Notable Weapons (Book 1)
| Weapon | Type | Owner | Notes |
