# Characters of Astra's Plain

This document covers every character who appears in or is relevant to Book 1, plus key characters from future books who the writer needs to know about for foreshadowing purposes. Characters are grouped by their role in the story.

---

## THE FOUR MAIN CHARACTERS

These four characters are the emotional core of the entire series. Book 1 follows all four of them through separate arcs that converge at the end.

---

### ASTRA — The Weapon Who Learns to Feel

**What He Is:** A being of immense power created by Ray, the Goddess of Blood. He was made to be a living weapon — a tool for peace. He has no memories of being born, no childhood, no emotional development. He is not robotic or cold — he is *hollow*. There is something inside him that wants to understand, but he doesn't have the framework.

**Personality:** Quiet. Observant. He watches everything with amber eyes that glow when his power surges. He rarely speaks, and when he does, it's often a question. He doesn't understand why people sacrifice for each other, what love feels like, or what it means to "be alive."

**The Emotional Arc (across the full series):**
Astra's emotional development follows a specific, deliberate progression:
1. **Nothing** — At the start, there is genuinely nothing inside him. No emotions, no framework for understanding them.
2. **Faking** — He learns to mimic. Smiling when others smile, nodding when they laugh. It's performance, not feeling.
3. **Faking so much it becomes natural** — The performance becomes reflexive. He no longer thinks about when to smile — it just happens. But he's still not sure if it's real.
4. **Blurred** — He can no longer tell the difference between what's performed and what's genuine. Is the tightness in his chest when Jack dies fake? He doesn't know. Neither does the reader.
5. **Real** — The feelings are undeniably his own. He grieves, he loves, he sacrifices — and he knows it.

The **bulk of this emotional development happens in Book 2**, when Angelina teaches him what love is. In Book 1, Astra is mostly in stages 1–2, with cracks appearing at stage 3. Each tiny shift should feel earned and significant.

**His Journey Across the Series:**
- **Book 1:** Weapon → Person discovering the edges of emotion
- **Book 2:** Falls in love with Queen Angelina. Learns what it means to feel — and to lose.
- **Book 3:** Father figure to Leo. Discovers his true origins (he was *born*, not made). Kills the Almighty One.
- **Book 4:** Has been God for thousands of years. Becomes the core of Heaven — the paradise he creates but can never participate in.

**Book 1 Specifics:**
- First appears in Chapter 1.4, standing amidst destruction in Corvaz holding the green Realm Stone
- Ray's final command to him was "survive" before she died
- Uses the Realm Stone to help Sforza's family escape to the Terra Realm
- Lives with the family for decades; Sforza treats him almost like a son
- Develops a deep bond with Sophia (she is drawn to him; he doesn't understand why)
- Travels with Sophia to Kilson; they are attacked and separated
- Joins the Bayleen Hunters bounty guild in the desert town of Ioawa
- Jack teaches him about family and sacrifice through example
- Blake has a philosophical conversation with him about what it means to be alive
- Astra sees Ray's reflection in a river and reaches for it — she's not there
- During the Kingpin Xiomi arc, he discovers Astrical Aura (healing ability) he didn't know he had
- Jack dies telling Astra to "protect my family for me… and tell my little girl daddy loves her"
- The guild is massacred; Astra feels something stirring — determination, protectiveness — and runs back to save them
- In the final fight with Horux, his Sealed Markings reach red for the first time
- After Horux's defeat, a blue light heals him with a whispered "Your time has not yet come"
- Heads to Solamina alone to rebuild and search for Sophia

**Key Trait for the Writer:** Astra's emotional development is glacially slow but each tiny crack in his armour should feel earned. He doesn't have dramatic emotional outbursts. His feelings surface in micro-expressions — a twitch of the face, gripping his chest, reaching for a reflection. The reader should be *aching* for him to feel before he actually does.

**The Significance of "Survive":** Ray's last command — "survive" — is the most important word in the series. Astra was created to follow orders. He has **never once disobeyed a command** in his entire existence. Every instruction given to him, he carried out. "Survive" became the singular directive that drove everything he did. At the end of the series (Book 4), Astra sacrifices himself to become the core of Heaven — the paradise he creates but can never participate in. This is the first and only time Astra **disobeys** Ray's command. He chooses to stop surviving so that everyone else can live forever. The weight of that final act depends on the reader understanding that obedience was *all he knew*.

**Secret the Writer Needs to Know:** Astra was not "created" — he was actually *born* to two gods (Ray and the God of Foresight and Wisdom). Ray took him as a baby and transformed him into a weapon, hoping he would bring peace. This is not revealed until Book 3. His amber/orange eyes are inherited from his father, and they carry the power of foresight (seeing seconds into the future), which he doesn't discover until Book 4.

**How Astra Was Made Into a Weapon:** Ray created a **serum** that controlled memories — it suppressed Astra's identity as a born child and rewired him as a blank tool. To shape him into the ultimate weapon, Ray worked with two collaborators:
- A **demon** — whose blood was infused into Astra, giving him his demonic power. This demon was later **interrogated by other demons** who learned about the weapon Ray had created. This intelligence is what led the demons to incite the dragon attack on Corvaz — they wanted Ray dead before her weapon could be used against them.
- **Varek, the God of Attack** — whose blood, combined with Ray's own blood, shaped Astra's angelic side and combat capabilities.

The demon's betrayal (being captured and interrogated) is the direct cause of Ray's death. The dragons didn't attack Corvaz by coincidence — they were pointed there.

### SOPHIA — The Strategist Who Chose Power

**What She Is:** The eldest child of Dimitri and Sforza. A Demi (half-angel, half-dragon). She inherited her mother's Mist — a subtle, insidious power that lets her create illusions, walls of fog, and most dangerously, manipulate minds through whispered mist from her lips.

**Personality:** Intelligent, calculating, fiercely protective of those she loves. Sophia is not evil, but she is willing to do morally grey things to protect her family and achieve her goals. She manipulates Prince Balavis's mind, controls The Umbro without their knowledge, and plays political games with genuine skill. Beneath the strategy is a deeply emotional person — she left with Astra because she couldn't bear to stay after Dark killed their parents. She loves Astra, though she would never be so vulnerable as to say it outright in Book 1.

**Her Journey Across the Series:**
- **Book 1:** Enters the political world of Kilson, builds an elite military force, marries into royalty
- **Book 2:** Her Umbro soldiers fight gods. She fuses with Futures and Dark into The Primordial One to subdue berserk Astra. Becomes ruler of the gods after the Circle of Ten is destroyed.
- **Book 3–4:** Ends up with Leo (Astra's descendant) but carries complicated resentment — she loved Astra, but he only ever loved Angelina. Her Mist is what makes the Dead Realm beautiful enough to become Heaven.

**Book 1 Specifics:**
- Trains with Futures as a child; she's the elder, more experienced sibling
- Devastated when parents leave for the war (the letter scene in the rain)
- Close bond with Astra over the decades in the Terra Realm
- Leaves with Astra when she decides to explore the world
- In Kilson, she separates from Astra to protect him — creates a wall of Mist
- Rescued by Kilson Royal Guards; taken in by the royal family
- Builds The Umbro — an elite team of soldiers she trains with Mist
- Manipulates Prince Balavis's mind to ensure his compliance
- Queen Velera reveals she knows Sophia is a god — leading to a deal
- Marries Prince Balavis for strategic advantage (not love)
- Uses Mist to subtly control courtiers who challenge her
- Her Umbro soldiers grow suspicious of her influence (Willow and Patch conspire)
- Final scene: A dragon is spotted, and Sophia says "Looks like his powers have awoken" — referring to Futures

**Key Trait for the Writer:** Sophia is the character who most clearly demonstrates the cost of power. She is good at manipulation — terrifyingly good — but each act of control distances her from genuine connection. The reader should simultaneously admire her intelligence and feel uneasy about her methods.

---

### FUTURES — The Angry Son Who Learns Discipline

**What He Is:** Second child of Dimitri and Sforza. A Demi (half-angel, half-dragon). Inherited his father's Blue Lightning and his dragon blood, which allows him to partially — and eventually fully — transform into a dragon.

**Personality:** Hot-headed, proud, and carrying deep pain beneath his anger. Futures was their father's favourite, and he knows it. He resented Dark for being "the problem child," and this resentment contributed to Dark's descent. After his parents' deaths, guilt and rage consume him — guilt because he knows his treatment of Dark helped cause this, and rage because he can't undo it. Under Shranota's training, he learns that raw power without precision is worthless, and that his anger must become a tool rather than a master.

**His Journey Across the Series:**
- **Book 1:** Angry exile → disciplined martial artist → partial dragon transformation → reconciliation with Dark
- **Book 2:** Continues growing. Fuses into The Primordial One. Travels to the Draconic Realm to find his lineage.
- **Book 3–4:** Further development TBD

**Book 1 Specifics:**
- Opens the story training with Sophia; they're close siblings
- Devastated by parents leaving for war
- Over decades in Terra Realm, his sparring with Dark becomes increasingly hostile
- After Dark kills their parents, they fight and go separate ways
- Buries his parents in the rain, vows vengeance
- Wanders into Kilson seething with rage; almost electrocutes a group of thugs
- Master Shranota stops him and challenges him: fight me, and if I win, you become my student
- Futures is arrogant — he's a *god*. He charges with Blue Lightning. Shranota matches his fist with a metal leg and knocks him unconscious. Metal shards fall from the leg on impact.
- Wakes in a dojo full of students. Given the Stamoid block challenge — he fails spectacularly
- Dante demonstrates the correct technique (precision, not force)
- Forbidden from using Blue Lightning under threat of expulsion
- Slowly learns momentum, timing, precision. Gets beaten by every student at first.
- Dante gives him crucial advice: "Use your anger to enhance your weapon, not as the weapon itself"
- Beats Dante on the second-to-last day before the tournament
- Enters the Singhi Tournament. Dominates early rounds.
- Beats Blitz (the #2 ranked fighter) by learning his patterns
- Finals against Pharoh interrupted by Oraylious's meteor attack
- Trapped in Void Veil. Negotiates Pharoh's release.
- Unleashes Blue Lightning (breaking Shranota's rule). Partially transforms — forearms, hands, feet, shins become dragon scales and claws. Eyes turn yellow dragon eyes.
- Kills Oraylious. Disqualified. Shranota says he's proud of him anyway.
- Dante joins him; they leave together to search for Dark and Astra
- Confronted by Dark (possessed by demon). Futures drops his anger and *apologises*.
- "I love you brother" — these words bring the real Dark back to the surface
- Impaled by Dark but survives. In the final battle, transforms into a FULL dragon for the first time — massive blue and black, Blue Lightning breath attack
- Destroys Zion. Reconciles with Dark. Shakes his hand. Heads to Solamina with Dante to find Astra.

**Key Trait for the Writer:** Futures' arc is about learning that strength without wisdom is destruction. He is the most traditionally "shōnen protagonist" of the four — hot-headed, determined, growing through combat — but his emotional growth is what matters most. His apology to Dark is the most important thing he does in Book 1.

---

### DARK — The Cursed Son Who Finds Redemption

**What He Is:** Third child of Dimitri and Sforza, but unique — a half-angel, half-demon hybrid. Before he was born, a Black Demon cursed Sforza's womb, infusing Dark with demonic essence. This made him an abomination in the eyes of divine law and is why the family was exiled.

**Personality:** Dark is not inherently evil. He is a deeply wounded person who was born into a situation where he was hated for *existing*. His father Dimitri openly favoured Futures. The Circle of Ten wanted him killed in the womb. He grew up knowing he was the reason his family lost everything. A mysterious demonic voice in his head has been manipulating him since childhood, amplifying his resentment, isolation, and rage. When he kills his parents, it is under the demon's influence — but the resentment the demon exploits is real. Dark's redemption arc is about separating his genuine pain from the demon's manipulation and choosing love over hatred.

**His Journey Across the Series:**
- **Book 1:** Manipulated villain → breaks free from demon → redeemed by his brother's love
- **Book 2:** Travels to the Demonic Realm to understand his lineage. Fuses into The Primordial One.
- **Book 3–4:** Further development TBD

**Book 1 Specifics:**
- Born with demonic essence — the reason the family was exiled
- Neglected by Dimitri, who clearly favours Futures
- A mysterious voice in his head grows louder over the years
- In Chapter 1.6, manipulated by the voice, Dark kills both parents. This is the story's inciting incident.
- Fights Futures; the home burns. They separate.
- Wanders Kilson rooftops radiating darkness and bloodlust
- Approached by Oraylious, who invites him to meet Zion and join Oracle
- At Dansia Chapel, meets Zion. Priest Tomo is casually decapitated. Dark shakes Zion's hand and feels how overwhelmingly powerful he is — "like his life is in Zion's hands"
- Zion demonstrates power: crushes Milo (a girl with animal summoning magic) effortlessly
- At Temporal Library, Dark kills five people on command without thinking. Zion gives him the Ring of Solis — it manifests holy fire on Dark (his weakness). Nothing happens when used on Zion.
- Sent with Baxter to kill A-class Enforcers Vian and Host. Brutally outmatched at first.
- **Turning point:** As he's dying, Dark sees fear in the demon inside him for the first time. He breaks free from the demon's grip — the grip that had controlled him since he killed his mother. He feels like *himself* for the first time.
- With his full godly power (not split with the demon), he kills both Enforcers
- Ishido Fuju attacks Oracle. Uses Soul Separation on Dark — but the DEMON takes over Dark's body while Dark's soul goes to the Astral Plain
- In the Astral Plain, Dark meets his parents' souls. They tell him they love him no matter what. Dark tears up — perhaps the most emotionally devastating moment of his arc.
- Meanwhile, the demon-controlled Dark attacks Shranota's Dojo, massacring students (Manta and Weaver die trying to help). Shranota loses an arm saving the remaining children. His last words to the demon: "This was never part of the deal…" — referring to Sforza's plan.
- The demon-Dark confronts Futures. But Futures doesn't attack — he apologises. The real Dark, trapped inside, hears his brother's words. The demon rejects them, charges forward, impales Futures.
- Dark's eyes flicker. He regains control. He steps back horrified.
- Puts the demon behind "mental bars of the subconscious"
- Final battle alongside Futures against Zion, Snide, and Lacray
- Dante saves Dark's life by stabbing Zion from behind (gets backhanded unconscious)
- Dark finishes off Zion, who reveals that Sforza planned everything — every path each child would walk
- Dark heals Dante with his Mist (not perfectly, but enough)
- Shakes Futures' hand. Heads to Kilson to find Sophia.

**Key Trait for the Writer:** Dark is the most tragic character in Book 1. He is not a villain — he is a victim of circumstance, prejudice, and literal demonic possession. His redemption should feel earned but fragile. When he breaks free from the demon, it's not triumphant — it's exhausted and broken. When he cries seeing his parents' souls, the reader should cry too.

**Secret the Writer Needs to Know:** Everything was planned by Sforza. She orchestrated the path for **each of her three children**: Dark with Zion, Futures with Shranota (whom she threatened), and Sophia toward Kilson's political world. She sacrificed herself as part of a grand plan whose full scope is not revealed in Book 1. The only person she didn't plan for was **Astra** — he was the one variable outside her control.

---

## THE PARENTS

### SFORZA — The Mother Who Planned Everything

**Title:** Goddess of Mist
**Race:** Valerian Angel
**Status:** Deceased (killed by Dark, Chapter 1.6)

Sforza is a deeply complex character. She is warm, nurturing, and treats Astra almost like a son. She loves all her children fiercely. But she also made coldly calculated plans for **every single one of her children**:

- **Dark** — She made a deal with **Zion** to take Dark in and guide his demonic side, knowing the demon would drive him to kill her and Dimitri.
- **Futures** — She made a deal with **Shranota** (by **threatening his dojo** — if he didn't comply, she would destroy everything he'd built). Shranota would train Futures into a disciplined warrior.
- **Sophia** — She orchestrated the path that would lead Sophia to **Kilson**, where she would enter the political world and build her power base.

**Astra was the ONLY one she didn't plan for.** He was the variable she couldn't control — a weapon made by another god, with no emotional framework for her to manipulate. Everything Astra does across the series is genuine and unscripted. This is what makes him dangerous and ultimately what makes him worthy of becoming God.

She read Astra's memories when the family first arrived in Terra Realm and discovered unsettling truths she kept to herself. Her Mist power was passed to Sophia and (in a darker form) to Dark.

**In the Astral Plain:** Her soul appears to Dark and tells him she loves him no matter what. This moment of unconditional love from the mother he killed is Dark's emotional turning point.

**The Grand Plan:** Zion reveals before his death that Sforza orchestrated everything — Dark meeting Zion, the Enforcer kills, all of it. And she had similar plans for Futures and Sophia. Her children were never truly lost — they were walking paths she designed. But Astra? He was always free.

### DIMITRI — The Father Who Played Favourites

**Title:** God of Lightning
**Race:** Demi (half-angel from Godly Realm royalty, half-dragon from Draconic Realm's Elder 5 bloodline — his **mother** is from the Elder 5 line)
**Age:** 1,560
**Status:** Deceased (killed by Dark, Chapter 1.6)

Dimitri is brave, powerful, and deeply devoted to Sforza. He defies the Circle of Ten to save his family. But he has a fatal flaw: he openly favours Futures over Dark. This isn't malicious — Futures inherited his lightning, shares his temperament, and is the son he relates to. Dark is… something else. Something that frightens him.

This favouritism is the soil in which Dark's resentment grows. Dimitri never realises the damage he's causing until it's too late.

His Blue Lightning was passed to Futures. His dragon heritage (Elder 5 bloodline) gives both Futures and Sophia their Demi nature and Futures' ability to transform.

---

### RAY — The Goddess Who Made a Weapon

**Title:** Goddess of Life (one of The Original 5)
**Status:** Deceased (killed during dragon attack, Chapters 1.4–1.5)

One of the five most ancient and powerful gods ever created. Ray worked at The Palios Temple monitoring the Cleansing Pods. She discovered Sforza's demonic pregnancy and tried to warn the family, inadvertently triggering their persecution.

She created Astra — or so it appears. The truth (revealed in Book 3) is that Astra is her biological son with the God of Foresight and Wisdom. She took him as a baby and transformed him into a weapon, hoping he would bring peace.

Her final moments: reaching Astra during the dragon attack on Corvaz, whispering "survive" as her last command, then dying. Her death is the first time Astra feels anything — a crack in his emotional void.

**Why the Dragon Attack Happened:** The demon who helped Ray create Astra was later **captured and interrogated** by other demons. Under interrogation, the demon revealed everything — the weapon, the serum, Ray's plans. The demons realised that if Ray's weapon was completed and deployed, it could turn the tide of the Holy War against them permanently. They **incited the dragon attack on Corvaz** to kill Ray before the weapon could be used. The dragons, being mercenaries, were hired for the job.

**The Dragon That Killed Ray:** The dragon was a **direct descendant of an Elder Dragon** — not an Elder itself, but close enough in bloodline to be physically devastating. It was raw physical power that killed Ray, because Ray, despite being one of the five most ancient and powerful gods in existence, was **never good at combat**. She was magically powerful beyond measure — her abilities with blood, life force, and creation were unmatched — but she was not a fighter. She couldn't defend herself against a direct physical assault from a creature of that magnitude.

Astra sees her reflection in a river in Chapter 3.2, reaching for it. She appears as a hand on his shoulder that vanishes when he turns. The blue light that heals him after the Horux fight whispers "Your time has not yet come" — strongly implied to be Ray.

**Secret:** Ray created a serum that controlled memories and suppressed identity — this is what she used to transform baby Astra into a weapon. She worked with a demon (whose blood gave Astra his demonic power) and Varek, the God of Attack (whose blood gave Astra his combat abilities). In Book 4, the villain Mazylin obtains this serum and uses it to weaken Astra and possess his body.

## KEY SUPPORTING CHARACTERS (BOOK 1)

### Dante — The Narrator of Everything

**Race:** Human
**Weapons:** Starborn Wakizashi & Harpy Wakizashi (dual-wielded)
**Special Skill:** Master at manipulating opponents' momentum and hitting weak points

Dante appears to be a skilled but ultimately normal human fighter. He trained at Shranota's Dojo, where he demonstrates the Stamoid block technique that humbles Futures. He gives Futures the crucial advice about channelling anger as enhancement rather than weapon.

He joins Futures after the tournament and travels with him. In the final battle, Dante saves Dark's life by impaling Zion from behind — an incredibly brave act from a human against a being with goddess-level power. He's backhanded unconscious for his trouble.

**The Secret:** Dante is the narrator of the *entire series*. This is revealed **twice**:

1. **End of Book 2:** The story pulls back to reveal that Dante is **alive** — old, in a **wheelchair**, telling this story to his **three children** before he dies. The reader realises they've been hearing a dying man's tale. This is emotionally devastating.
2. **Book 4 (Final Scene):** Dante has died. But he's still telling the story — now from **an armchair in Heaven**, surrounded by multiple generations of his family, all reunited in the afterlife. The reader initially thinks the Book 2 reveal was the full truth, but the switch from wheelchair to armchair, from living room to paradise, recontextualises everything. The entire series was an afterlife campfire tale told by a dead man in a paradise his friend built from grief.

**For the Writer:** Plant Dante as a character the reader grows to love deeply but perhaps underestimates. He's funny, warm, loyal, and brave despite being outclassed by literally everyone around him. His importance should sneak up on the audience.

### Zion — The Man Who Made a Deal

**Race:** Human
**Magic:** Gravity Magic (acquired from drinking blood stolen from **Eana, the Goddess of Gravity**, by Sforza)
**Affiliation:** Leader of Oracle
**Status:** Deceased (killed by Dark, Chapter 6.3)

A human who made a deal with a goddess and gained terrifying power. He can crush people into the ground, force them to kneel, and shape gravity into precise weapons. He is charismatic, calculating, and genuinely powerful — when Dark shakes his hand, Dark (a *god*) feels like his life is in Zion's hands.

But Zion overreached. He was supposed to take in Dark and let him settle his score with Futures (per Sforza's plan). Instead, he tried to recruit Dark into Oracle for his own purposes. This defiance of Sforza's plan is ultimately what dooms him.

Before dying, Zion reveals the truth about Sforza's grand plan — that everything was orchestrated.

### Master Shranota — The Old Man With the Metal Leg

**Race:** Human
**Weapon:** Azura's Katana (can cut through Mist better than anything)
**Status:** Alive but maimed (lost an arm in the dojo massacre; already had a metal leg)

An old martial arts master who runs a dojo in Kilson. He's deceptively powerful — he defeats Futures (a god) in single combat by matching Blue Lightning with his metal leg. Small metal shards fall from the leg on impact, hinting at its unusual construction.

He teaches precision and momentum over raw power. His training transforms Futures from a rage-fuelled brawler into a disciplined fighter.

He made a deal with Sforza in the past — but not willingly. Sforza **threatened his dojo** — if he didn't agree to train Futures when the time came, she would destroy everything he'd built. When the demon-Dark massacres his students, Shranota's last words — "This was never part of the deal…" — reveal that Sforza's plan did not include the dojo's destruction. Shranota survives but is devastated, saving only one student and that student's younger sister.

### Jack — The Family Man

**Race:** Human
**Status:** Deceased (sacrificed himself at Seirra Square)

A seasoned bounty hunter who learned killing from his father Kevin as the only way to make money. Doesn't like killing but has accepted it for his family's safety. His wife Lacy and daughter Millie are at the guild.

Jack is Astra's first real teacher about what it means to be human. Not through lectures — through *being*. Astra watches Jack's devotion to his family and sees something he can't name. Jack talks about accepting consequences for the safety of those you love, and Astra listens without speaking, but the reader can see "cogs turning" in his head.

His death scene: stepping forward with Blake to hold off Horux and Kingpin Xiomi so the others can escape. His last words to Astra: *"Protect my family for me… and tell my little girl daddy loves her."* These words haunt the rest of the book — and the rest of the series.

### Blake — The Philosopher

**Race:** Human
**Status:** Deceased (sacrificed himself at Seirra Square alongside Jack)

A hunter who follows Astra on a nighttime walk and finds him crouching by a river, watching swans. Astra asks him questions that reveal the depth of his emptiness: *Why do people risk their lives for others? What does it feel like when emotions well up? What is it like to "be alive"?* Blake gives the best answer he can. This scene — quiet, intimate, profound — should be one of the most memorable in the book.

### Mandy — The Sharpshooter

**Race:** Human
**Status:** Alive

Fierce, emotional, and an incredible sniper. When the guild is massacred, she falls to the ground vomiting and crying. She blames Astra — screaming "It's all your fault!" — her grief needs a target. But when it matters, she makes the shots that count: hitting Kingpin Xiomi through the Viola Veil while crying so hard her vision is blurred, shooting Horux's hand to let Astra grab Millie, and ultimately making the killing shot through the gap in Horux's helmet.

### Millie — The Girl He Promised to Protect

**Race:** Human (child)
**Status:** Alive

Jack's young daughter. She looks up at her crying mother Lacy cluelessly when told her father is dead. She is kidnapped by Horux and used as a hostage. Astra rescues her. Jack's dying wish — *protect my family* — becomes Astra's unspoken vow.

### Pharoh — The Tournament Champion

**Race:** Human (demi-god blood)
**Status:** Alive

Student of Master Easton's Pheonix school. Ranked #1 going into the Singhi Tournament. Has wings and can fly. Can deprive opponents of oxygen. Has demi-god blood that explains his extraordinary abilities.

The tournament finals between Pharoh and Futures is interrupted by Oraylious's attack. Pharoh protects Futures from the meteor at great cost to himself. Later watches Futures transform and whispers *"How was I ever going to beat that?"* — a moment of awe rather than jealousy.

He knew Milo (the girl Zion killed) and has tears in his eyes at the scene.

### Ishido Fuju — The Monster in Human Form

**Race:** Human
**Magic:** Soul Separation
**Status:** Alive (disappeared after the fight)

The S-class Enforcer of District 2 in Kilson. The strongest S-class, equivalent to 10 A-class Enforcers. When he arrives at the Dansia Chapel doors and throws Baxter's severed head onto the floor, every character in the room — including Zion — is afraid.

He tears through Oracle's members with terrifying efficiency: kills Tailors via Soul Separation, fights Zion to near-death, and only disappears after using Soul Separation on himself (white eyes, absorbed souls' power) as a last resort.

His Soul Separation backfires on Dark because the demon takes over the body when Dark's soul is ejected — something Ishido could not have predicted.

### Orion — The Foreign Guard

**Race:** Human
**Status:** Alive

Guard to King Soaran of the Kingdom of Haall. Wears distinctive silver and grey robes. Confronts Sophia, revealing suspicions about her true nature. Possesses unique abilities that challenge Sophia. Their encounter introduces political tension and demonstrates that Sophia's manipulations have limits.

### Horux — The Purple Knight

**Race:** Human
**Status:** Deceased (killed by Mandy's sniper shot)

Oracle member who wears purple-plated armour with dark ominous grooves. The armour heals itself when cracked. He's the one who split up Sophia and Astra when they first arrived in Kilson (his symbol matches the attacker's). He punches a hole through Astra, blocks a rocket with his palm, and rips Astra's arm off.

In the final confrontation, Astra reaches red Sealed Markings and manages to crack Horux's helmet. Mandy shoots through the gap, killing him.

### Kingpin Xiomi — The Sadist

**Race:** Human
**Status:** Deceased (shot by Mandy)

A dangerous criminal lord in Laofia. Sadistic and theatrical — he throws the corpse of the man who hired the Bayleen Hunters at their feet, displays Jack and Blake's severed heads in a chest, and has the guild's address written on a note beside them. He calls Astra a "worthless, emotionless doll." Mandy shoots him through the Viola Veil with tears blurring her scope.

## CHARACTERS FOR FUTURE BOOKS (Foreshadowing Reference)

### Queen Angelina (Book 2 — Astra's Love)

Queen of Solamina. Half-angel, half-demon (her father is Satan, one of the 12 Devils). Uses Soul Manipulation. Cunning, smart, but kind. She is the person who teaches Astra what love is.

She dies protecting Astra in the Book 2 finale — blocking a death-scythe swing from Nova meant for the entire battlefield. Astra never stops loving her, even thousands of years later.

Astra heads toward Solamina at the end of Book 1 — heading toward the love of his existence without knowing it.

### Leo (Book 2–4 — The Descendant)

Youngest prince of Solamina (age 9 in Book 2). Left on a doorstep as a baby. He is actually Astra's distant descendant — Astra's father (God of Foresight and Wisdom) had a child with a human woman, and Leo descends from that bloodline. This is why they can fuse and why Astra feels drawn to him.

Astra becomes Leo's father figure. Leo stays with Astra for thousands of years. Leo and Sophia end up together (complicated — Sophia loved Astra, Leo knows he's "second choice").

### The God of Foresight and Wisdom (Book 3–4 — Astra's Father)

Not one of The Original 5. Had heterochromatic eyes: one orange (foresight — see seconds into the future) and one green (intention reading, eventually mind reading). When Astra was born, he lost his orange eye's power. When Alister (Astra's brother) was born, he lost his green eye's power entirely — becoming blind.

He also loved a human woman and had a child with her. That human bloodline leads to Leo.

### Alister (Book 4 — Astra's Brother)

Astra's younger brother, introduced in Book 4. Has green eyes (inherited intention/mind reading). Mazylin's first target for body possession — but the attempt fails, so Mazylin targets Astra instead.

### Mazylin (Book 4 — The Final Villain)

Releases an ancient demon, obtains Ray's original serum (used to subdue baby Astra), uses it to weaken Astra, and takes over his body. The closest Astra ever comes to losing — not through being overpowered, but through being possessed. How do you fight when the enemy IS you?

### Dawn (Book 3 — The Strongest)

The strongest of The Original 5. Pure raw power. Defeated all 3 Rerium alone, killing 1. Executed Tenlith for treason (siding with devils). When Tenlith died, his floating swords each became a new god (Nova, Miiac, Qazar, and others).

### The Primordial One (Book 2)

A temporary fusion of Dark, Futures, and Sophia using their combined Mist abilities. Created during the Book 2 finale when Miiac stops time and reverses it to heal the three siblings. They fuse to subdue Astra's Uncontrolled Form (triggered by Angelina's death). After subduing him, they separate — crying, holding Astra. **Varek (the God of Attack)** dies protecting them during this process.
