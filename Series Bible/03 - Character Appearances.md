## The Family

### Sforza

**Physical:**
- **Eyes:** Silver — bright, striking, immediately noticeable. They carry an unsettling clarity, as though she is always seeing more than what's in front of her
- **Hair:** Rich brown, worn in an elaborate **plaited braid** — the kind of intricate, layered braiding that looks effortless but would take a human hours. It falls over one shoulder or down her back depending on the scene. The braid is thick, heavy, and immaculate — not a strand out of place. It is the hair of a goddess: beautiful by nature, not by effort
- **Face:** Classically beautiful. High cheekbones, a strong jaw softened by full lips, and a face that can shift from warmth to ice in a heartbeat. She has the kind of beauty that makes people forget what they were saying
- **Build:** Tall, slender, and graceful. She moves like water — every gesture fluid, every step deliberate. There is no wasted movement. She does not look physically powerful, which is part of the deception. Her power is her Mist, her mind, and her presence
- **Age (apparent):** Mid-thirties in human terms. Mature, composed, undeniably in her prime

**Clothing:**
- Sforza dresses in **flowing, layered garments** — long robes and draped fabrics that move with her like extensions of her body. Think Grecian influence but more refined: **sheer veils** layered over structured underlayers, the fabrics catching light as she moves
- The colours tend toward **whites, silvers, and pale blues** — ethereal, deliberate, almost bridal in their elegance. The sheerness of the outer layers gives glimpses of the structured garment beneath without revealing anything — it's suggestion, not exposure
- She wears minimal jewellery — perhaps a thin silver chain at the collarbone or a single ring. She doesn't need adornment. The clothes *are* the statement
- **The purpose:** Sforza weaponises her beauty and elegance. She knows exactly what she looks like and uses it — not as seduction, but as *authority*. When she enters a room draped in flowing white with silver eyes and that perfect braid, people defer before she opens her mouth. It's armour made of silk. Sophia will inherit this instinct later in the series

### Dimitri

**Physical:**
- **Eyes:** Black — deep, dark, and difficult to read. Where Sforza's silver eyes are piercing and immediate, Dimitri's are guarded. You have to earn what's behind them
- **Hair:** Black, kept relatively short and practical. Not shaved, not long — functional. It's the hair of someone who doesn't think about his hair
- **Face:** Strong, angular features. A squared jaw, a straight nose, and the kind of face that looks carved rather than born. Handsome in a weathered, lived-in way — not pretty, but striking
- **Build:** Toned and athletic but **not hugely built**. He is not a wall of muscle. His body is built for **speed and precision** — lean, efficient, every muscle earned through movement rather than brute force. But there is visible strength there: the forearms are corded, the shoulders are broad enough, and the way he carries himself suggests that the restraint is deliberate. He *could* be bigger. He chooses not to be. His fighting style favours accuracy and velocity over raw power — and his body reflects that
- **Age (apparent):** Late thirties in human terms. Lines around the eyes that speak to experience, not exhaustion
- **Demi heritage:** Dimitri is half-angel, half-dragon (Elder 5 bloodline). There is nothing visibly draconic about him at first glance — no scales, no unusual skin, no visible tells. He passes as a pure Valerian Angel. This is deliberate

**Clothing:**
- Dimitri dresses **practically** — function over form, always. His clothing is designed for movement: fitted but not tight, layered but not heavy
- He wears a combination of **dark fabrics and plated elements** — leather-like underlayers with sections of **light armour plating** at the shoulders, forearms, and chest. The plating is not ornamental; it's worn and scratched from use. This is gear that has seen combat
- The clothing also serves a secondary purpose: **concealing his dragon heritage**. The high collar, the layered chest piece, the long sleeves — they cover any part of his body where draconic traits might show under stress or during combat. Whether he has scales that emerge, skin that shifts, or markings that appear is left ambiguous — but his clothing is clearly chosen to make sure no one ever sees
- Colours are **dark — blacks, charcoal greys, deep browns**. He does not draw attention to himself. Next to Sforza's flowing silver, he looks like her shadow. This is intentional. He is the shield beside the banner

### Sophia

**Physical:**
- **Eyes:** Silver — inherited from Sforza. The same bright, striking silver that her mother carries. On Sophia, they are sharper, more watchful. Where Sforza's silver eyes command, Sophia's silver eyes *assess*
- **Hair:** Black — inherited from Dimitri. Long, dark, and usually worn loose or pulled back casually. It doesn't have her mother's elaborate braiding (not yet — that elegance comes later in her arc). At 70 god-years (~23 human), her hair is more practical, sometimes falling across her face during training
- **Face:** A blend of both parents. She has Sforza's bone structure — the high cheekbones, the clean lines — but Dimitri's intensity. Her resting expression is alert and slightly guarded. When she smiles, it transforms her face entirely; when she's serious, she looks older than her years
- **Build:** Athletic and light on her feet. She has a dancer's build — not bulky, but clearly strong. Her movement is graceful (inherited from Sforza) but with a sharpness to it that is entirely her own. She fights like someone who learned from both a mist-wielder and a speedster
- **Age (apparent):** Early twenties in human terms (~23). Old enough to be taken seriously, young enough that the weight she carries is visibly unfair

**Clothing:**
- At this point in the story, Sophia dresses simply — **practical training clothes** when sparring, and comfortable but unfussy clothing around the house
- She has not yet developed her mother's instinct for weaponising appearance. That comes later. For now, she dresses like someone who might need to move quickly at any moment — which she might
- Colours lean toward **dark tones** — she takes after Dimitri in this regard. Dark trousers or fitted leggings, simple tops, boots that are built for grass and mud, not marble floors

### Futures

**Physical:**
- **Eyes:** Silver — the same striking silver as Sophia and Sforza. On a child's face, they are even more arresting. There's something almost unsettling about eyes that bright on someone so young
- **Hair:** Black — inherited from Dimitri. Messy, unkempt, the kind of hair that a 10-year-old refuses to let anyone brush. It falls across his forehead and into his eyes when he's fighting
- **Face:** Still has the softness of childhood. Round cheeks that haven't sharpened yet, a jawline that will one day be strong but is currently buried under baby fat. His expressions are wide and unguarded — everything he feels is written on his face in real time
- **Build:** Small and wiry. He's a child — there's no muscle definition, no imposing frame. But he moves with a natural quickness that hints at what he'll become. He's all nervous energy and fast reflexes
- **Age (apparent):** ~10 years old in human terms (30 god-years). Small for the power he carries

**Clothing:**
- Whatever a 10-year-old would wear when left largely to his own devices — simple, slightly rumpled, probably grass-stained
- Training clothes that are functional and forgiving of being rolled in, thrown in, and scorched by his own lightning
- No armour, no adornment, nothing formal. He's a kid

## The Circle of Ten (As Seen in Chapter 1.1)

### Qazar

**Physical:**
- **Eyes:** Glowing white — not merely light-coloured but actively **luminous**, as if lit from within. They have no visible iris or pupil. When he looks at someone, it feels less like being seen and more like being examined by something that operates on a different frequency. The glow is constant, not situational — his eyes never look normal
- **Hair:** **Black and white, two-toned** — not streaked or greying, but distinctly split between the two colours in a way that is clearly unnatural. The dual colouring is a direct manifestation of his power over both **darkness and light**. The exact pattern (split down the middle, sections, or gradient) can be interpreted by the writer, but it must be clearly intentional and striking — this is not age, this is *power made visible*
- **Face:** **Sharp.** Every feature looks deliberately carved — a narrow nose, defined cheekbones, a jawline that could cut glass. There is nothing soft about Qazar's face. No warmth in the lines, no laughter in the corners of his eyes. He is handsome the way a blade is beautiful: precise, cold, and dangerous
- **Build:** **Honed to perfection.** Qazar's body is not merely fit — it is a statement. Broad shoulders, a narrow waist, arms that are sculpted without being grotesquely large. Every line of muscle is visible and intentional, as though he was built to a mathematical ideal. He does not hide his godly nature — he *displays* it. His physical form is meant to intimidate, and it does
- **Age (apparent):** Ageless. He could be 30 or 3,000. There are no lines, no wear, no imperfections. He looks like a statue brought to life

**Clothing:**
- Qazar is robed in **utter royalty**. His garments are the most extravagant of any god — long, layered robes of deep **blacks, golds, and whites** that flow behind him when he walks. The fabrics are rich and heavy, embroidered or edged with metallic thread that catches light
- He wears his station openly. Where Sforza's elegance is subtle and Dimitri's practicality is humble, Qazar's clothing screams *I am the one in charge and I want you to know it*
- There may be a **circlet, crown, or headpiece** — something that frames the two-toned hair and glowing eyes. Not a humble leader's garment. A ruler's
- **The purpose:** Qazar does not hide his godly nature. He leans into it. He wants every person who sees him to feel the full weight of what he is. His appearance is a weapon — it tells you, before he opens his mouth, that you are beneath him

### Jupiter

**Physical:**
- **Eyes:** Mismatched — one **white**, one **red**. The white eye appears **blind**, clouded over, with a **visible scar** running through or across it. Whether the eye is truly sightless or merely looks it is ambiguous — but the effect is unnerving. The red eye is vivid and sharp, carrying all the intensity that the white one lacks. Together, they make his face look like two different people stitched together
- **Hair:** **Bald.** Completely shaved, no stubble, no shadow. The baldness emphasises the brutality of his features — there is nothing to soften the hard lines of his skull, the thickness of his neck, the scarred eye
- **Face:** Broad, heavy-set, and aggressive even at rest. A thick brow, a wide nose, a mouth that naturally settles into something between a sneer and a grin. His face is built for confrontation. When he laughs — which he does often and loudly — it doesn't make him look friendlier. It makes him look like a predator showing its teeth
- **Build:** Large and powerful. Unlike Dimitri's lean efficiency or Qazar's sculpted ideal, Jupiter is **built for war**. He is broad, thick, and visibly strong in a way that prioritises function over aesthetics. He takes up space. He is meant to take up space
- **Age (apparent):** Hard to pin down. The baldness and scars make him look older; the raw physicality makes him look younger. He is a weapon that has been used extensively

**Clothing:**
- **Golden armour with red accents.** Jupiter wears combat gear to a council meeting — that alone tells you everything about him. He is either always ready for a fight or always wants people to think he is
- The armour is **plate-style** — pauldrons (shoulder plates), a chest piece, gauntlets — polished gold with deep **crimson red** detailing in the engravings, joints, and trim. It's well-maintained but not pristine — there are dents and scratches that he hasn't bothered to repair, like trophies
- He wears a **red cape** — heavy, draped from one or both shoulders, falling behind him. It's dramatic and militaristic. He is not subtle and has no interest in subtlety
- No crown, no circlet, no jewellery. Jupiter doesn't decorate. He armours. The message is simple: *I am here to fight, and I don't care what you think about it*

### Miiac

**Physical:**
- **Body:** Miiac is the first god in the story who **does not look human**. His surface — it may not be skin at all — is a deep, polished **brown**, the colour of dark wood or aged bronze. It is so smooth and clean it has a **metallic sheen** that catches the light, glinting almost **gold** at certain angles. He doesn't look organic. He looks *crafted* — as if someone sculpted him from a material that doesn't exist in nature
- **Head:** Shaped roughly like a **cross** — not a human skull at all. The proportions are elongated, geometric, alien. There are features where eyes would be, but they don't sit where a human's would. The effect is ancient and unsettling — he looks like something that predates the gods themselves, which he does in a sense (born from Tenlith's swords)
- **Posture:** Perfectly upright. **Hands clasped behind his back.** Always. He stands like a monument — still, centred, immovable. He does not fidget, shift his weight, or gesture. He has been standing like this for a thousand years and will stand like this for a thousand more
- **Build:** Tall and straight. Not muscular, not thin — simply *present*. His frame does not suggest combat. It suggests patience
- **Demeanour:** Speaks with careful, deliberate **wisdom**. Every word is chosen with the precision of someone who knows what every possible word would cause — because he does. He sees past, present, and future, but he **cannot say what he sees**. He can hint. He can guide. He can ask the right question. He cannot give the answer

**Clothing:**
- **Deep green garments** — rich, earthy green, draped simply over his form. The simplicity is elegant in the way that *time* is elegant: unhurried, inevitable, without need for decoration
- No armour, no embellishment, no jewellery. The green against his polished brown-gold surface is striking — ancient and grounded
- He is the visual opposite of Qazar: where Qazar screams *look at me*, Miiac says *I have been here longer than you and I will be here after you are gone*

### Ray

**Physical:**
- **Eyes:** Blue — clear, vivid, striking. Not the silver of Sforza's bloodline — a true blue, like deep water or unclouded sky. Warm but guarded
- **Hair:** Black — similar to Dimitri's colouring but longer, worn down and straight. Well-kept, framing her face
- **Skin:** Pale — noticeably fair, giving her an almost ethereal quality against the dark hair. The contrast between pale skin, black hair, and blue eyes is deliberate — she is beautiful in a quieter way than Sforza. Less weaponised, more natural
- **Face:** Gentle features that carry weight behind them. She looks kind — and she is — but there is an exhaustion in her expression that kindness alone doesn't explain. She has been carrying something for a very long time
- **Build:** Similar to Sforza in frame — graceful, slender — but Ray carries herself differently. Where Sforza commands a room, Ray occupies a corner of it. She is powerful but does not advertise it. She is one of The Original 5 — older and more powerful than almost anyone alive — but she wears it like a scar, not a crown
- **Age (apparent):** Similar to Sforza — mid-thirties in human terms. But there is something in her eyes that looks far older

**Clothing:**
- Practical but with grace — not as flowing as Sforza's garments, not as martial as Dimitri's. Robes that allow movement, in muted colours — **blues, greys, whites**
- She looks like a healer, which is what she is — she worked in the Palios Temple monitoring Cleansing Pods
- No adornment, nothing that draws attention. Ray dresses to *not* be noticed, which is itself a choice

## Visual Contrasts (Writer's Reference)

These pairings are deliberate and should be reinforced through description:

| Contrast | Character A | Character B | What It Says |
|----------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Elegance vs. Brutality** | Sforza (flowing veils, silver eyes, composed) | Jupiter (golden armour, scarred eye, loud) | Two kinds of power: influence vs. force |
| **Display vs. Concealment** | Qazar (robes of royalty, glowing eyes, body on display) | Dimitri (dark layers, plated armour, hiding his nature) | One flaunts godhood, one hides half of himself |
| **Mother and Daughter** | Sforza (braided brown hair, silver eyes, weaponised beauty) | Sophia (loose black hair, silver eyes, not yet weaponised) | The potential — Sophia will become this, but isn't there yet |
| **Father and Son** | Dimitri (black hair, black eyes, controlled power) | Futures (black hair, silver eyes, uncontrolled energy) | The inheritance — same colouring, opposite temperament |
| **The Silver Eyes** | Sforza → Sophia → Futures | — | The family marker. Every child has their mother's eyes |
| **Human vs. Inhuman** | Ray (black hair, blue eyes, pale skin — entirely human in appearance) | Miiac (polished brown-gold surface, cross-shaped head — alien, crafted, ancient) | Two of The Original 5 — one looks like anyone you'd pass on the street, the other looks like nothing that has ever existed |
| **Healer and Seer** | Ray (muted blues, quiet presence, dresses to disappear) | Miiac (deep green, statuesque stillness, impossible to ignore despite trying) | Both carry unbearable knowledge. One hides from it, the other stands in it |
