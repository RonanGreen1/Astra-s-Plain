## Important Notes for the Writer

1. **Nothing in this package is secret from you.** Every twist, every death, every reveal across all 4 books is documented. Use this knowledge to plant seeds, foreshadow, and build emotional payoff from the very first chapter.

2. **Book 1 is told from multiple POVs.** The story follows four main characters whose paths diverge and reconverge: Sophia, Astra, Futures, and Dark. Each has their own Part of the book.

3. **Astra does not understand emotions.** He was created as a weapon. He is not robotic — he is *hollow*. He watches humans and tries to understand. When he starts to feel, he doesn't recognise what's happening. This is the emotional core of the entire series.

4. **The tone is serious but not grim.** There is warmth — found family, humour between comrades, quiet moments by rivers. The darkness comes from loss, betrayal, and the weight of legacy.

5. **The world is not medieval Europe.** This is a multi-realm fantasy with its own cosmology, races, and power structures. The Terra Realm (where most of Book 1 takes place) has a mix of technology levels — guns exist alongside swords, bounty hunter guilds alongside royal courts.

6. **This is ultimately a creation myth.** The entire series explains why Heaven exists, why there's no magic in the modern world, and why energy can't be created — only transferred. Keep this in mind as the deeper truth beneath the action.

## Word Count Estimation

| Part | Sub-chapters | Beats (~words) | Estimated Prose |
|------|----------|----------------|------------------|
| Part 1 — The Exile | 1.1–1.6 | ~3,000 | 15,000–25,000 |
| Part 2 — Sophia's Rise | 2.1–2.6 | ~3,500 | 18,000–28,000 |
| Part 3 — Astra's Hunt | 3.1–3.6 | ~4,500 | 22,000–35,000 |
| Part 4 — The Dojo | 4.1–4.6 | ~4,000 | 20,000–30,000 |
| Part 5 — Oracle | 5.1–5.6 | ~4,000 | 20,000–30,000 |
| Part 6 — Brothers' War | 6.1–6.3 | ~3,000 | 15,000–25,000 |
| **Total** | **33 sub-chapters** | **~22,000** | **110,000–173,000** |

The target is a standard fantasy novel length. Each sub-chapter's beats should expand roughly 5–8x into prose. Parts 4 and 5 are the densest, containing the tournament arc and the Oracle arc respectively. Part 6 is the climactic convergence.
