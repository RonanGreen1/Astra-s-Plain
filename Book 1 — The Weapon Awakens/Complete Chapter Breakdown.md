# Book 1 — The Weapon Awakens

## How to Read This Document

This document contains the complete story of Book 1, broken into 30 chapters across 4 parts. Each chapter corresponds to one episode from the original outline. The text below is **not prose** — it is a detailed scene-by-scene breakdown of everything that happens. The ghost writer's job is to turn these beats into full prose chapters.

### Estimated Word Count
- **Current beats:** ~15,000–20,000 words total across all 30 chapters
- **Target prose:** 90,000–150,000 words (a standard fantasy novel)
- **Average chapter length in prose:** 3,000–5,000 words
- **Expansion ratio:** Each chapter's beats should expand roughly 5–8x into prose

### Point of View
The story uses **third-person limited**, rotating between four POV characters:
- **Part 1** — Primarily family ensemble (Sophia, Futures, Sforza)
- **Part 2** — Sophia and Astra (alternating chapters)
- **Part 3** — Astra
- **Part 4** — Futures, Dark, and ensemble

**Astra's POV** should feel clinical and observational at first, slowly becoming more emotionally textured as the book progresses.

**Sophia's POV** should be sharp, calculating, and politically aware — she reads rooms the way generals read battlefields.

**Futures' POV** should burn with emotion — anger, frustration, pride, and eventually humility and love.

**Dark's POV** should feel fractured — two voices in one head, reality warping between his perceptions and the demon's whispers.

# PART 1 — THE EXILE
*Chapters 1–6: The family is torn apart*

---

## Chapter 1 — Torn Bonds and War's Eve
*Original title: "Torn Bonds and War's Eve"*

The chapter opens in the Circle of Ten — the ruling council of ten gods. They are in heated debate about their involvement in the Holy War. The air is thick with tension. Qazar chairs the meeting. Jupiter is outspoken and is interrupted by Qazar, who puts the proposition of gods fighting on the front line to a vote. The vote passes. Dimitri and Sforza are chosen to attend a battle in the coming days.

Cut to a serene backyard where Sophia and Futures train together. Sophia is the elder, more experienced sibling. She pushes Futures to his limits with a mix of sternness and care.

Family dinner. Sforza and Dimitri reveal they must join the war. The peaceful atmosphere shatters. Sophia's emotional turmoil and Futures' confusion paint a portrait of a family caught in the war's gravity.

A private moment between Sforza and Dimitri — they express their fears and uncertainties about what's coming. The personal cost of their duty weighs on them.

Sophia and Futures share a heart-to-heart. They discuss their powers, the reality of their parents fighting, and the fear that comes with it. Their bond is strong — mutual support in the face of dread.

**The gut-punch:** Unable to face their children, the parents leave a letter explaining their departure. The next morning, Sophia and Futures find the note. A powerful, devastating scene.

The chapter ends with Sophia comforting Futures in the rain. Family, duty, and the cost of war — all in one image.

---

## Chapter 2 — Shadows and Prophecies
*Original title: "Shadows and Prophecies"*

Sophia and Futures sit on a couch wrapped in towels, recovering from the emotional storm. Sophia assumes the protective elder sibling role, explaining to Futures that as gods, their parents have a duty to shield the powerless.

At the Circle of Ten, Miiac and Ray have a profound discussion about an ancient prophecy foretelling a great war (not the current Holy War — something bigger, something yet to come). The weight of this conversation hints at cosmic stakes beyond the current conflict.

The battlefield. Valerian Angels and Demons are locked in fierce combat. Sforza and Dimitri arrive with their legion and turn the tide in favour of the angels. Their presence is formidable — a testament to the power of the gods.

But the victory is short-lived. A Black Demon emerges — a direct servant of one of the 12 Devils. The battle between Sforza, Dimitri, and the Black Demon is intense. In a dramatic turn, as the Black Demon takes its last breath, it curses Sforza's womb with a demonic baby.

**This is the origin of Dark.** The curse that will destroy this family has been planted.

---

## Chapter 3 — Echoes of Deceit and a Fateful Escape
*Original title: "Echoes of Deceit and a Fateful Escape"*

The Palios Temple. Ray monitors the Cleansing Pods containing the recovering Dimitri and Sforza. She discovers an anomaly in Sforza's pod — the demonic presence.

Jupiter returns from the battlefield, weary and bloodied. Ray urgently wakes Dimitri and Sforza to reveal the demonic pregnancy. Jupiter overhears and sees an opportunity — he will use this to destroy the family.

Miiac helps Ray escape, sensing the danger. The temple buzzes with the news. The gods declare Sforza's condition an act of treason — in divine law, harbouring a demon in any way is treason. Sforza was expected to kill her own unborn child. She refused.

Dimitri and Sforza attempt a frantic escape with a mysterious vial. Jupiter confronts them, declaring his intent to capture Sforza and eliminate Futures and Sophia. Nova intervenes, stalling Jupiter and revealing the complex power dynamics among the gods.

In a desperate move, Dimitri flies away with the children just in time, narrowly escaping the gods who have turned against them.

---

## Chapter 4 — Shattered Sanctuary and Unforeseen Alliances
*Original title: "Shattered Sanctuary and Unforeseen Alliances"*

A sweeping view of Corvaz, the majestic capital city of the Godly Realm. Towering skyscrapers of celestial architecture, a city bustling with angelic inhabitants. Then — a secluded alleyway, where Sforza, Dimitri, and the children hide from the Circle of Ten.

They regroup in an under-construction building. Cut to Ray, on the run. Her emotional turmoil is visible as she reaches Astra — her creation. A profound bond between them, and a sense of impending loss.

A misty portal opens in the sky above Corvaz. Dragons pour through. The Circle of Ten (minus Miiac) rallies to confront this new threat, temporarily forgetting about Sforza's family.

A pivotal moment: Dimitri converses with a dragon in a familiar tone, revealing a hidden connection (his Draconic Realm heritage). But the reunion turns sour — the dragon attacks. The family is buried in rubble.

As they recover, a mysterious silhouette emerges through the dust.

**ASTRA'S FIRST APPEARANCE.** Standing amidst destruction, amber eyes glowing, holding the green Realm Stone.

---

## Chapter 5 — A New Realm and Uncharted Bonds
*Original title: "A New Realm and Uncharted Bonds"*

The family confronts the mysterious figure — Astra. Flashbacks reveal the moments leading to this encounter: Ray's final command to Astra — *"survive"* — as she dies in the dragon attack.

With the Realm Stone, a plan is hatched to escape to the Terra Realm. The teleportation is disorienting. The family arrives in an alien landscape — verdant fields, distant mountains. Earth.

A wary local with a crossbow confronts them. Dimitri prevents violence — the family needs caution in this unfamiliar world.

Sforza and Sophia use their powers to construct a log cabin in the wilderness. Dimitri and Futures venture into a nearby village, encountering the humans of the Terra Realm and learning about its dynamics.

**Key scene:** Sforza reads Astra's memories. She discovers unsettling truths that she decides to keep to herself. (The reader doesn't learn what she saw — this is a seed planted for Book 3.)

The chapter ends with the family, now including Astra, beginning their new life in the Terra Realm.

---

## Chapter 6 — Time's Passage and Unfolding Destinies
*Original title: "Time's Passage and Unfolding Destinies"*

**THE INCITING INCIDENT.**

A time-lapse montage: decades pass. The family lives in the Terra Realm. Futures and Sophia grow. Dark is born. The passage of time is marked by:
- The deepening bond between Astra and Sophia
- Increasingly intense training battles between Futures and Dark
- Sforza remaining a nurturing mother to all, including Astra (treated almost like a son)
- Futures' cold demeanour toward Dark — growing resentment
- A mysterious voice in Dark's head, growing louder

Sophia confides in Astra by a river — she wants to explore the world. Astra, usually emotionless, shows a hint of concern. Their conversation is interrupted.

Sophia prepares to leave with Astra. Their departure mirrors the letter left by their parents — a rhyming echo of abandonment.

**THE TURN:** Dark, influenced by the voice in his head, commits a shocking act of violence — he kills both parents. The demon amplified his real resentment into murderous action. Futures encounters Dark in the aftermath. A fierce battle. The family home burns to the ground.

**Result:** The four main characters scatter:
- Sophia leaves with Astra (already departed)
- Futures stays to bury his parents, then goes alone
- Dark vanishes into the night

---

# PART 2 — SOPHIA'S RISE
*Chapters 7–12: Sophia enters the political world of Kilson*

---

## Chapter 7 — Crossroads and Unseen Threats
*Original title: "Crossroads and Unseen Threats"*

Astra and Sophia enter the bustling city of Kilson on horseback. They are outsiders in a vast, unfamiliar human city.

An assailant in black and purple attire (bearing Oracle's symbol) attacks them. Sophia creates a wall of Mist to protect Astra and separates them. Astra reluctantly leaves. Sophia fights the attacker — gains the upper hand but is caught off-guard. Rescued by the Kilson Royal Guards.

Wounded, Sophia is taken in by the Kilson Royal Family: King Alon, Queen Velera, and their charming son Prince Balavis. They offer hospitality and protection.

Sophia is drawn into Kilson's political intrigues. Prince Balavis shows evident affection. Sophia proposes building an elite team of soldiers — The Umbro. Her strategic mind impresses the court.

The chapter ends with Sophia accepting the prince's request, marking her deeper involvement in Kilson politics and her increasing distance from Astra.

---

## Chapter 8 — Alliance and Shadows
*Original title: "Alliance and Shadows"*

Sophia begins forming The Umbro. Accompanied by Prince Balavis, she observes the kingdom's soldiers in training, selecting candidates based on unique skills and potential.

The selected soldiers — each with distinct abilities (strength, weapon mastery, agility) — are introduced. Sophia trains them with her Mist, challenging and enhancing their abilities. Training scenes are interspersed with Sophia and Balavis discussing their plans.

**The dark turn:** Sophia manipulates Prince Balavis's mind using her Mist — whispering mist from her lips ensures his compliance. This reveals the morally ambiguous side of Sophia. She is willing to do terrible things for her goals.

The Umbro soldiers become proficient and loyal to Sophia, unaware of the true extent of her influence. This sets the stage for future ethical dilemmas.

The chapter ends with Sophia reflecting on her actions and the growing complexity of her role.

---

## Chapter 9 — Converging Paths and Hidden Agendas
*Original title: "Converging Paths and Hidden Agendas"*

Sophia continues training The Umbro while pursuing her underlying mission against the Circle of Ten.

The arrival of King Soaran of the Kingdom of Haall and his guard Orion introduces new political dimensions. Orion wears distinctive silver and grey robes. Sophia notices him.

Sophia observes training from a distance, assessing each soldier's talent. Prince Balavis expresses growing admiration and trust, unaware of her inner conflicts.

**Confrontation:** Orion approaches Sophia. Mutual respect escalates into tension. Orion has suspicions about Sophia's true nature. His insights force Sophia to confront potential consequences.

Sophia uses her powers to manipulate Orion's perception — securing her position but leaving her internally conflicted.

Twist: Orion possesses unique abilities that pose a genuine challenge to Sophia. Not everyone can be controlled so easily.

---

## Chapter 10 — The Dance of Deception and Power
*Original title: "The Dance of Deception and Power"*

Sophia and Orion clash physically. Under a blossom tree, leaves swirling, they fight — it's a test of wits and strategy as much as strength. Sophia is genuinely challenged.

The Umbro join the fight, wielding Mist-enhanced weapons. But Orion is formidable, pushing them all to their limits.

Orion gains the upper hand. Sophia reveals the full extent of her power — a barrage of Mist blinds him, letting The Umbro regroup.

Sophia takes control by bending Orion's mind with Mist. Victory, but at what cost?

The chapter ends with the kingdom preparing for a major political event. Sophia is more powerful but increasingly isolated by her secrets.

---

## Chapter 11 — Tangled Webs and Royal Ambitions
*Original title: "Tangled Webs and Royal Ambitions"*

Sophia navigates royal court duties and strategic planning. Her heart is torn between growing responsibilities and thoughts of Astra.

Prince Balavis proposes marriage. Sophia weighs personal feelings against strategic benefit.

She overhears palace staff expressing concerns for the prince's safety. This insight sways her decision — she accepts the proposal with strategic objectives in mind.

King Alon and Queen Velera initially reject the marriage, citing an arranged political marriage with the Kingdom of Haall. Tension rises as Sophia and Balavis confront the royal family.

**Revelation:** Queen Velera reveals she knows Sophia is a god. Delicate negotiation follows. An agreement solidifies Sophia's influence and grants her the royal family's support.

The Kilson Royal Wedding. Sophia stands beside Balavis. Her expression: satisfaction and uncertainty. Power gained, but at the cost of her original path.

---

## Chapter 12 — Royal Intrigues and Unseen Shadows
*Original title: "Royal Intrigues and Unseen Shadows"*

Sophia as princess, seated beside Balavis. Beneath the surface: a complex web of court politics and personal agendas.

A courtier openly challenges Sophia's position. Balavis moves to defend her, but Sophia stops him. She leans in and whispers to the courtier — Mist emanating from her lips. The scene leaves the nature of the interaction to the reader's imagination.

The Umbro discuss their unease with Sophia's growing influence. Willow and Patch conspire to uncover her true intentions. Sophia thwarts their plan, further solidifying her control.

**Final scene:** Someone bursts into the room breathless — a dragon has been spotted. The last line is Sophia's face as she says: *"Looks like his powers have awoken."*

She's referring to Futures.

---

# PART 3 — ASTRA'S HUNT
*Chapters 13–18: Astra discovers what it means to be human*

---

## Chapter 13 — Unravelling Loyalties and Emerging Threats

Focus shifts to Astra. We retrace his steps from the moment Sophia told him to leave — his solitary journey through unfamiliar territories.

Astra arrives in Ioawa — a small, desolate desert town. A confrontation between two bounty hunters (Mandy, Janim) and a local criminal named Brass. Astra intervenes — quick, decisive, displaying formidable ability. The bounty hunters take notice.

Janim invites Astra to join the Bayleen Hunters. Astra, seeking purpose, accepts. The guild is a tight-knit group of diverse individuals — bounty hunting is a life of danger, camaraderie, and moral ambiguity.

Astra engages with guild members. Each interaction peels back layers of his character — his struggle to understand human emotions and motivations. His conversations with Jack are key: Jack is a family man who talks about the sacrifices of the profession.

Astra embarks on his first mission. It tests his skills and his understanding of right and wrong.

---

## Chapter 14 — *[Untitled]*

Astra and several Bayleen Hunters stalk Gumpo in Ioawa. Gumpo is a scrawny man who threatens Astra with a Blunt Rusted Blade. Before he knows what happened, his arms are broken. Shot from above: Astra's amber eyes glow. Adam moves in laughing, friendly with Astra. They chase down two others and collect the bounty from King Istaliaara of the Casp Dried Plains region.

At an inn that night, Astra stays with Jack. Jack reveals that Lacy (at the guild) is his wife and Millie is his daughter. Jack talks about how he doesn't like killing but it's the only skill his father Kevin taught him. He's accepted the consequences for the safety of his family. *It's a very one-sided conversation* — Astra barely talks — but "some cogs are turning inside his head."

**THE RIVER SCENE:** During the night, Astra slips out. Blake follows. He finds Astra crouching beside a river, watching swans. Blake asks what he's doing. Astra responds with questions: *Why do people risk their lives for others? What's it like to have emotions well up inside you? What is it to "be alive"?*

Blake looks down at Astra, who is gripping his clothes where a heart would be. Blake gives him the best answer he can.

Astra stares into his reflection. He reaches out to touch it — just before his fingers reach the water, he sees Ray's reflection behind him, her hand on his shoulder. He whips around. Nobody there but Blake.

---

## Chapter 15 — *[Untitled]*

Jack wakes up — Astra's bed is empty. He goes downstairs where everyone is eating breakfast made by Elada. Astra is sitting there. Jack gets mocked for sleeping late.

The plan: one more job before heading home. Kill Kingpin Xiomi in the capital city of Laofia. He's well-known, dangerous, and the guild has been specifically hired with a high reward.

The group of six departs — more serious than usual. Except Astra, still thinking about Ray's face.

They arrive at Seirra Square. **Ambush.** Surrounded by Xiomi's men. Kingpin Xiomi appears with Horux — the man in purple-plated armour bearing the same symbol as the one who attacked Sophia and Astra.

Xiomi throws the corpse of their employer at their feet. Everyone except Xiomi and Horux attacks. The six are extremely skilled — they take out multiple enemies. But ammo runs low (Jack, Adam, Janim are gun users), and Saphire's gadgets are spent.

Horux blitzes forward. Only Astra is quick enough to react. They clash. Astra pushes his Sealed Markings to orange — much greater heat than yellow. While Astra tries to hold off Horux, Saphire aims her Rocketeer at Xiomi.

**Horux punches a hole through Astra** and blocks the rocket with his palm. Xiomi laughs maniacally.

**JACK'S SACRIFICE:** Jack steps forward with Blake. They tell the others to run. Jack looks back at Astra, barely conscious: *"Protect my family for me… and tell my little girl daddy loves her."* He turns to face Xiomi.

The three survivors carry Astra and flee. Behind them, Jack and Blake hold the line against Horux. Xiomi grins as they look back.

---

## Chapter 16 — *[Untitled]*

Back at Bayleen Hunters HQ. The news is broken. Lacy collapses into tears. Millie looks up at her cluelessly. Others hold back tears; anger fills many. They plan revenge — everyone except children and non-fighters will join.

The plan: five scouts lure Xiomi back to their territory for an ambush. The team: Astra, Mandy, Larson, Adam, Janim, and Saphire.

In Laofia, they're led on a wild goose chase, fighting underlings, until they find Xiomi's headquarters. The room they expect him in contains: a small wooden chest with the heads of Jack and Blake. And a note with their hideout's address written on it.

The building collapses around them. Astra saves them all and surrounds them in Astrical Aura — a healing ability he didn't know he had. It slowly restores their energy and wounds.

**Astra's first real feeling:** He stands and blitzes away back to the hideout. *"For the first time in his life wanting to save someone and feeling determination."* He can't tell if these emotions are real or the ones he's been faking.

He arrives. Opens the door. **The entire guild has been slaughtered.** Bodies and blood cover every surface. Everyone he knew — brutally murdered. His face twitches as he steps over bodies.

The others arrive. Mandy falls to the ground vomiting from the sight, tears falling. Larson is stiff, wide-eyed. Astra stands, hands covered in blood, and turns to the group:

*"Millie and Lacy aren't here."*

---

## Chapter 17 — *[Untitled]*

The group sits outside against the wall of their fallen headquarters. Tears run dry, eyes reddened — except Astra's. He stands quietly pondering this feeling welling up inside him. He looks at his blood-stained hands.

*"I'm going after them."*

Mandy explodes — blaming Astra for everything. The others calm her. After back-and-forth, they agree to work together.

They enter the seemingly abandoned town. Take positions. Mandy on a roof with a sniper. The rest follow Astra down the main street. Out of nowhere — Kingpin Xiomi ahead, with Horux.

Mandy can't see them — she's outside the Viola Veil set up by Horux. Comms go silent when they see what's at Xiomi's feet.

**Lacy is dead.** Head detached. Millie is crying, restrained in Horux's arms.

Xiomi steps off Lacy's body and smiles. *"This Astra… this was caused by you… your weakness, your lack of speed… you are a worthless, emotionless doll."*

Astra drops his head.

*"Look at her… look at her, pathetic little shit,"* Xiomi says, picking up Lacy's head. Millie's muffled wails.

Mandy, tears falling onto her sniper scope, vision blurred. She screams: *"It's your fault… it's all your fault!!"*

Before anyone can stop her, she fires a blind shot through the Veil. Screen goes black. A body hits the floor. As Xiomi falls — a pair of amber eyes. Xiomi is down.

*"Go get him boys,"* Mandy says.

They attack Horux. He tries to kill Millie — Mandy shoots at his hand, he dodges, but it gives Astra enough time to grab Millie.

He hands her to Larson. Looks at Horux with a grin.

*"Behold the power of a doll."*

---

## Chapter 18 — *[Untitled]*

Flashback: Sforza telling Astra what he will encounter in the future.

**ASTRA VS HORUX — THE FULL FIGHT.** Purple-plated armour with dark grooves clashes against bare skin. Mandy provides covering fire. Astra pushes Sealed Markings to orange. He presses his palm against Horux's chest and shoots a beam — Horux is pushed back but mostly unfazed. The armour cracks but heals itself.

Horux attacks — Mandy shoots his foot to throw off his balance, saving Astra's head. They strategise mid-fight but realise they can't break the armour fast enough.

**Horux rips Astra's left arm off** and sends him flying. Astra feels the magic draining. He slowly stands, remembering Sforza's and Ray's words.

His Sealed Markings all go dark for five seconds — then burst back on in **blistering red**. So hot that buildings around him begin to melt. The others retreat from the heat. Mandy can barely withstand it at her distance.

Astra lunges — a blur — grips Horux's helmet and shoots a beam into it. Both scream. Horux punches Astra in the gut — all markings dissipate, body collapses. Horux's burnt face is visible as the armour slowly reforms: *"Close, Astra… but I guess she was wrong."*

**Mandy shoots through the gap in the helmet.** Horux falls dead.

Astra lies motionless with one arm. The camera pans up: Horux's body, the others running to Astra, Millie and Larson at Lacy's body.

Darkness. Then: **a blue light** emanating from the centre. A soft voice whispers: *"Your time has not yet come."*

Astra opens his eyes. In a bed. His arm beside him — he reattaches it. He finds a note with a location: Dunbar Hill.

Outside, the town looks normal — people in the streets as if nothing happened. He climbs the hill and finds the five of them sitting under a tree, looking at wooden grave markers. He sits beside them. Hours pass. Nobody moves.

Back at headquarters (cleared of bodies, empty). They discuss futures. Astra will go to Solamina — to earn enough to rebuild and search for Sophia.

Goodbyes. The chapter ends with Astra riding through the desert toward Solamina.

---

# PART 4 — BROTHERS' WAR
*Chapters 19–30: Futures trains, Dark descends, and the brothers find each other*

---

## Chapter 19 — *[Untitled]*

Sforza's Lodge. Futures stands above two mounds of dirt — his parents' graves. Hands covered in dirt and mud. The lodge is burnt to ash behind him. Rain begins to fall.

He clenches his fist as tears well up, falling onto the mounds but lost in the rain. *"Whether it's one week from now, a year, or if I spend the rest of my life — I will avenge you both, even if it kills me."*

Lightning fills the sky.

Futures walks to Kilson, drenched and furious. A group bumps into him purposefully. Conflict begins. He directs them to a back alley, about to strike with lightning—

An old man's voice behind him: *Don't.*

**Master Shranota** challenges Futures to a fight. If Futures wins: information about Dark. If Shranota wins: Futures becomes his student.

Futures is arrogant — he's a *god*. He doesn't think he'll need powers. They engage. Shranota is blindingly fast — neither lands clean blows. Futures creates distance and charges with Blue Lightning.

Shranota jumps and matches Futures' fist with his right leg. A loud vibration. Futures is knocked unconscious. As Shranota lands, he stumbles slightly. Small metal shards have fallen from his leg.

---

## Chapter 20 — *[Untitled]*

Futures wakes on a bedroll in unfamiliar sleeping quarters. Sunlight through a small window. He walks through a hallway of similar rooms — sleeping quarters — and follows voices to a classroom.

Master Shranota stands at the front. Every student has a metal block (Stamoid) on a thin wooden frame. Objective: break the Stamoid without breaking the frame. Stamoid is the most absorbent metal on the planet.

Futures scoffs. Slams his fist down. The frame breaks. The Stamoid is completely intact — not even a mark.

The class scoffs at him. Shranota calls **Dante** forward. Dante places his hand slightly above the block, then quickly taps the top. The Stamoid splits perfectly in two. The frame is untouched.

Shranota consoles Futures: he will train him. But if Futures ever uses Blue Lightning, he's expelled.

Outdoor combat sessions begin. Futures faces Manta — he charges, confident, and ends up on the floor instantly. The fight is over before it began. He doesn't understand what happened.

Futures loses every fight that day. And the next. And the next. For a week, he loses to every student.

Shranota tells him about the Singhi Tournament. He starts explaining *why* Futures keeps losing: it's not about speed and power. It's about timing and precision. Momentum.

They visit the Lohoe Blacksmiths — two Onami Dwarves (Lof and Hoe) wielding small Sylian Hammers. They give Futures a Dargon Katana. Lof and Hoe smack their hammers together and teleport away.

The chapter ends with Futures looking at his reflection in the sword.

---

## Chapter 21 — *[Untitled]*

The one-on-ones continue. Futures watches more closely now. Against Mayvin, he notices her low-hand bait, avoids the trap, grabs her hand, pushes her into the ground, wins. Progress.

**FUTURES VS DANTE.** The bell rings — and Futures is on the ground staring at the sky. Dante's fist is pressed into a strange part of his chest. Not painful but deeply uncomfortable. The entire class is stunned. Even Shranota seems surprised. Dante walks off with a bow.

The rest of training shows both Futures and Dante dominant against other students — a compilation montage.

**THE POND SCENE:** Futures looks at his reflection in a pond, hair wet. He punches the reflection aggressively. His breathing speeds up. Dante walks out of the treeline behind him.

*"Why don't you use all that anger when you fight?"*

*"I thought the whole point is to control yourself? My anger didn't do much at the beginning."*

*"At first you used anger as your weapon because you had no other weapon. Now you use your weapon to control your anger — which means you're fighting two fights at once. Why don't you use your anger to enhance your weapon?"*

Dante leaves. Futures stands there pondering.

That night, walking back through moonlit woods, Futures finds Shranota standing before the dojo.

*"Pharoh and Blitz."*

*"Hmm?"*

*"Those are the ones you need to watch out for. They're definitely stronger than Dante. Probably one if not both finalists."*

*"Assuming I don't make it, you mean?"*

*"Yes. I don't see anyone else beating them. You need to get stronger these seven days."*

Training montage: snapshots of Futures getting stronger. He beats Dante on the second-to-last day.

The chapter ends with all students arriving at the Singhi Tournament arena.

---

## Chapter 22 — *[Untitled]*

**THE SINGHI TOURNAMENT.**

Singhi Stadium in central Kilson. Four fighting schools, four masters, four students each = 16 fighters in a knockout bracket.

**The Schools:**
- Master Shranota's Purpulious (techniques): Futures, Dante, Manta, Weaver
- Master Easton's Phoenix (cunning): Pharoh, Slingshot, Chain, Amara
- Master Nakamura's Omega (youngest, strongest master): Blitz, Pan, Specs, Panic

**Top 5 ranked:** 1. Pharoh, 2. Blitz, 3. Kian, 4. Omiah, 5. Chain

**Round 1:**
1. Futures vs Omiah — Futures wins easily, overpowering him and breaking his hand
2. Chain vs Amara — Chain wins
3. Blitz vs Weaver — Weaver is KO'd instantly despite their plan
4. Specs vs Slingshot — Specs wins
5. Pharoh vs Pan — Pan walks off without fighting

3. Pharoh vs Manta — Manta KO'd instantly
4. (continues next chapter)

---

## Chapter 23 — *[Untitled]*

**Round 2 continued:**
4. Kian vs Dante — Kian wins. Dante is helpless, loses both his wakizashis. Taken to the med room. Manta goes to check on him.

Just Shranota and Futures left at the bench. They discuss the Blitz fight.

**Semi-Final 1: Blitz vs Futures.** The first fight that makes Futures nervous. He can't use Blue Lightning, but he can *see* Blitz (reacting to his speed with godly perception). He's losing at first. He contemplates using his power — refrains. Slowly reads Blitz's patterns. Wins.

**Semi-Final 2: Pharoh vs Kian.** Pharoh KOs Kian immediately, but Kian gets back up in full instinct mode. One good shot lands before Pharoh flies him into the air, depriving his brain of oxygen. Pharoh wins.

**THE FINAL: Pharoh vs Futures.** They interlock hands and exchange words. For the first time, Pharoh uses his full power without hesitation — sensing Futures' strength. The fight is on a level above everything before. Backstory reveals Pharoh has demi-god blood, explaining his power.

The fight reaches its climax — both panting, injured, about to collide—

A burst of purple light. A massive black rock slams down from the sky between them.

---

## Chapter 24 — *[Untitled]*

Dust fills the stadium. The rock splits in half — Pharoh stopped it from hitting them both. He's heavily injured. Falls to one knee. Futures looks up.

A figure floats down from the sky. Black attire with purple woven through. The Oracle symbol on his forehead. **Oraylious.**

The four Masters ready fighting stances. But before they can attack, Futures and Pharoh are absorbed into a black sphere — the Void Veil. No one can breach it. Then it turns transparent, pushing everyone to the stands. Now visible from outside.

Futures, injured, picks up Pharoh and walks toward the edge. *"You're here for me. You restrained me so the boulder wouldn't hit me. Let Pharoh out and we can talk."* Oraylious chuckles at the deduction. He lets Pharoh through.

Oraylious explains: he's here to kill Futures on contract. He's far more powerful than Futures in his current form, and both of them know it.

Flashback to the deal: if Futures uses his powers, he's no longer Shranota's student. Futures looks at Shranota through the barrier. Shranota looks back. **Nods.**

Futures grins. Lightning flows from his body — smooth, controlled, not erratic like before. His body is strong enough now. He dashes forward, connects with a punch — shockwave shakes all of Kilson. Oraylious catches it. Purple magic pulls up debris. Rocks form around Futures' legs, locking him in place. Oraylious beats him while he's stuck.

Futures breaks free but is immediately brought to his knees. *"Weak. Inefficient."*

He remembers Dante's words about anger.

Lightning shockwave. Space created. Futures speaks:

*"I don't know who you are or what you are… but you have made a big mistake threatening me… mocking my family…"*

His skin flakes away around hands and forearms. Blue-black dragon scales form. Claws grow.

*"I am a god…"* Lightning whips from his body.
*"I am a Dragon…"* Eyes shift from grey to yellow dragon eyes.
*"I… am… Futures."*

Silence. Then an almighty roar — the image of a colossal dragon behind him.

One-sided beatdown. Futures rips through Oraylious's arm. Pharoh watches in awe: *"H-how was I ever going to beat that?"* He looks at Blitz to see if the speed specialist can track Futures — Blitz looks scared. Futures takes Oraylious's head.

The barrier falls. Shranota steps forward: *"As you are no longer my student, you are disqualified. Pharoh is the winner."* Futures nods. *"However… as someone who has known you for a short time, I'd like to say I'm proud of you."*

Dante watches with awe.

At the dojo: Futures packs a bag. Returns his sword to Shranota — he prefers his hands. He walks to the door. **Dante is waiting outside with a bag.** *"Are you sure you wanna come?"* Dante nods. They walk out together.

A bird's-eye view of the dojo in daylight. Then it flickers: the same dojo, covered in flames, blood on the garden stones. Night.

**FORESHADOWING. The dojo will burn.**

## Chapter 25 — *[Untitled]*

Dark stands on a Kilson rooftop, grinning, darkness flowing around him. A figure appears behind him. *"Are you looking for a fight?"* The man chuckles. **Oraylious.** He extends an invitation on behalf of someone else.

Dark follows him to the Dansia Chapel. Inside, Priest Tomo prays at the altar. Oraylious announces their arrival — and before Tomo stands a tall man in black leather with purple eyes. **Zion.** Leader of Oracle.

As Zion walks past Priest Tomo, seemingly doing nothing, Tomo's head slides from his shoulders.

Zion introduces his people: Oraylious, Baxter (the one who attacked Sophia and Astra), Tailors, and mentions Horux (away on business). He holds out his hand.

Dark hesitantly shakes it — and his eyes widen. He can feel Zion's essence surrounding him. *Like his life is in Zion's hands.* He nearly bows but resists.

They walk through the city. They pass Pharoh and Master Easton, who nearly stop in their tracks sensing Zion's power. Easton whispers to Pharoh: *"Just keep walking. I'll send Milo to watch them."*

They arrive at Kilson's Temporal Library. Zion points out a green sparkling squirrel — a girl named Milo watching them. Milo conjures a red fox and attacks. Dark fights her but can't keep up — she summons multiple animals. He realises he can't beat her.

Zion steps forward and clenches his fist. Milo's body is crushed into the ground. Mangled. Dead. All animals vanish. Dark's stomach twists.

Inside the library, Dark kills five people in a room before he even registers the request. Zion takes a ring from the lead man's finger — the Ring of Solis. Used on Dark: holy fire burns him. Dark uses it on Zion: nothing happens. Another reminder of Zion's power.

Outside: people gathering around Milo's body. Master Easton, Pharoh (tears in his eyes), two A-class Enforcers. Zion creates a Gravitational Collapse sinkhole. They escape.

Back at the chapel, Dark agrees to be trained. Zion explains the Enforcer system: Districts, S through D ranks, 8 S-class total, 20-25 A-class. District 2's S-class: **Ishido Fuju** — the strongest, equivalent to 10 A-class Enforcers. Dark asks why they'd go to that district. *"Even though he's the strongest, there's only one of him."*

---

## Chapter 26 — *[Untitled]*

Zion gives Dark a mission: kill two A-class Enforcers — Vian and Host. Vian is a katana master wielding Divinity. Host uses Colossal Possession.

Dark sets out with Baxter. They wait on rooftops above a dark alley. Hours pass. The Enforcers walk through. Dark and Baxter drop from either side.

The Enforcers are on a different level. Vian damages Dark faster than he can regenerate. Host disposes of Baxter quickly. 2-on-1 against Dark — Vian is a step above even Host.

As Dark feels his life slipping away, he sees **fear in the demon inside him** for the first time. And in that moment — he **breaks free** from the grip the demon has had over him since he killed Sforza.

He feels like *himself*. His full godly power surges — no longer split with the demon. He quickly kills Host (who let his guard down). He covers the area in Mist to counter Divinity's blinding light and finishes Vian.

Vian's last words to Dark linger and make him question what he's doing. But even though his inherent rage has diminished, hatred toward Futures remains.

The chapter ends at the Dansia Chapel. Dark, Zion, and Tailors are present. The doors open. Standing there: **Ishido Fuju.**

---

## Chapter 27 — *[Untitled]*

Dark, Zion, Snide, Lacray, and Tailors face Ishido Fuju at the chapel doors. Even Zion looks afraid. Dark can feel this man is on an entirely different level.

Ishido throws Baxter's severed head onto the floor.

Brief dialogue between Zion and Ishido. Zion tries Gravitational Collapse as a distraction to escape — but Ishido, even while falling, gets an attack off that barely misses Dark's face. They teleport to a basement with a sigil on the ground.

Zion wants to flee. Dark protests — he's here to kill Futures. Zion forces Dark to his knees with Gravitational Pull. *"He doesn't care what deal he made — she's gone. Dark should follow him."* Dark, confused by these words, fights back — Mist emanating — not enough to stand, but it's not easy for Zion either.

The basement wall comes off. Ishido Fuju stands in the street. He instantly uses Soul Separation on Tailors — Tailors' body collapses and is torn apart. Everyone is frozen with shock. Dark nearly vomits from Ishido's aura. Snide teleports away with Lacray.

Close quarters: Zion is outmatched. Gets hit with Soul Separation — his body collapses but remains unscathed (he fights in the Astral Plain and survives).

Dark fights Ishido alone. Outmatched. Ishido hits Dark with Soul Separation — **but Dark's body doesn't go lifeless.** The demon takes over the vacant body. Ishido didn't expect this. Dark grabs his arms, impales him with Mist tentacles. Ishido punches Dark into a wall.

Zion regains consciousness, stumbles to the street, and collapses the building.

**DARK IN THE ASTRAL PLAIN:** A blue dimension. Thin layer of water covering a flat, infinite floor. Deep blue sky. Dark turns and sees his parents — Sforza and Dimitri — in translucent soul form.

They explain this is the Astral Plain. If he had enemies here, he'd have to fight them (how Tailors died, what Zion experienced). Then they say it:

*They love him. No matter what. They will always love him.*

Dark struggles to hear these words. Tears fall. The mother he murdered loves him unconditionally.

He realises he can hear and vaguely see through his own eyes — the demon is using his body. But he can't get back in control.

Back with Zion: Ishido crawls from the rubble, battered and holed. They fight — Zion is enhanced by Lacray (2-3x strength, speed, perception). After exchanges, Zion wins — but Ishido uses Soul Separation *on himself* as a last resort. His eyes go white. Power from absorbed souls flows through him. He nearly kills Zion. Dark (demon-controlled) saves Zion at the last moment. Ishido disappears.

Dark tells Zion he's going to kill Futures whether Zion likes it or not. Zion tells him Futures is at Shranota's Dojo.

The chapter ends with Dark standing outside the dojo at night.

---

## Chapter 28 — *[Untitled]*

**THE DOJO MASSACRE.**

Dark enters the dojo grounds. Master Shranota meets him — not pleased, seemingly knowing who Dark is and why he's here. He says Futures is already gone.

Dark doesn't care. The demon is in control. A fight erupts between Dark and Shranota plus students. Most students try to flee. Dark slaughters them. Manta is killed helping Shranota. Weaver is killed trying to help.

Shranota struggles to protect students, defend himself, and attack simultaneously. His Azura's Katana slashes through Mist more effectively than anything — but it's not enough. The overwhelming Mist kills student after student.

Shranota could kill Dark if he focused entirely on offense — but he can't abandon the children. He saves the remainder: one student and that student's younger sister. Everyone else is dead.

Dark leaves after Shranota gives Futures' location. The last words Shranota speaks to the demon:

*"This was never part of the deal…"*

The demon is confused. We learn there was a deal between Sforza and Shranota. The dojo's destruction was NOT part of it.

Shranota is left: missing an arm (lost to Dark), already had a metal leg. The dojo is corpses and flames.

**CUT TO:** Futures and Dante walking and talking. Futures gets a bad feeling. A pillar of Mist slams down 50 meters ahead. Dark emerges with a smirk.

Standoff. Dark seethes. But **Futures has dropped his anger.** He becomes apologetic. Inside the possessed body, the trapped soul of Dark sits up, hearing his brother's words.

The demon rejects the apology — it invalidates his anger. Futures explains: his anger was jealousy. If he could take it back, he would.

The demon charges forward and **impales Futures.**

Futures' response: *"I love you brother."*

Dark's eyes flicker. **He is back in control.**

---

## Chapter 29 — *[Untitled]*

Dark takes a step back. He sees what he did — he impaled Futures. Futures falls to one knee, smirking, knowing there were two souls fighting inside his brother.

Dark confronts the demon internally. He doesn't need it anymore. The demon curses and insults him as Dark places it behind **mental bars of the subconscious.**

Futures waves off Dante's help, slowly rises. Brief introductions (Dante meets Dark). Then—

**Zion, Snide, and Lacray arrive.** Zion eggs Dark on to finish his brother. But the overwhelming anger has dissipated. Zion feels his grip on Dark slipping.

Zion brings all three to their knees with gravity. Dante is forced flat — feels like he's dying from the pressure. Dark and Futures drop to one knee. Futures slowly rises, lightning emanating. Dark watches in awe at how strong Futures has become — and guilt from the dojo massacre rises in his chest.

Futures sends lightning from the sky, breaking Zion's concentration and separating the Oracle members. Dante realises he's severely outmatched — watches with envy as Dark and Futures stand tall.

**Dark vs Zion.** **Futures vs Snide + Lacray.**

Oracle has the advantage at first. Snide's teleportation + Lacray's enhancement overwhelm Futures. But Futures begins reading Snide's teleport patterns. His feet, shins, forearms, and hands flake into dragon scales and claws. Massive speed boost. Tides turn.

Dark is getting battered. Zion pins him for a killing blow — **Dante impales Zion from behind** with both wakizashis. Zion grunts and backhands Dante — sent flying. Futures catches him and slides back from the force. Dante is unconscious.

Futures rises. Gently sets Dante down. Eyes glowing blue. Rage ignited.

---

## Chapter 30 — *[Untitled]*

Futures darts toward Snide — not Zion, which confuses everyone. That confusion gives Dark an opening.

Futures kills both Snide and Lacray. He catches Snide between teleports — faster and faster until Snide can't escape. It's brutal and methodical.

Futures stops behind Zion. Slightly out of breath. He and Dark fight Zion together. Even combined, Zion holds his own — using gravity in precise lines and shapes to disrupt specific body parts and attack vectors. The fight is gruelling; both sides landing heavy blows.

The brothers' chemistry grows: intertwining Blue Lightning and Mist to devastating effect. But Zion, going all out, lands consecutive strikes on Futures and slams him into a rocky hill, burying him.

Zion returns to Dark, who can barely stand. Beats him to his knees. Knees him in the face. Dark is flat on his back.

Zion monologues: *How good things could have been if Dark just followed him. His life turned to shit ever since he made that deal with "her."*

A rumble from the rocky hill. An ear-piercing roar. The entire hill collapses.

Flashback inside the hill: Futures lying there, voices in his head, a feeling overcoming him. His eyes open — glowing blue. **His entire body becomes a dragon.** This collapses the mountain.

A massive blue-and-black dragon emerges from the rubble. Roars. Breathes Blue Lightning at Zion. Despite its size, the dragon is impossibly fast. It picks Zion up, throws him in the air, speed-blitzes him, and finishes with a final breath of Blue Lightning that slams him into the ground.

Dark slowly gets to his feet. Stands above the dying Zion. Futures returns to human form and joins him.

**ZION'S DEATHBED REVELATION:**

Sforza made a deal with Zion. She gave him a vial of blood stolen from Eana, the Goddess of Gravity (which gave him Gravity Magic) in exchange for him taking in Dark and letting him settle his score with Futures. Everything — from their meeting to Dark killing the Enforcers — was planned by Sforza. She also threatened Shranota's dojo to ensure he'd train Futures, and orchestrated Sophia's path toward Kilson. Astra was the only one she didn't plan for. Zion tried to go against her wishes by recruiting Dark, which doomed him.

*It was the same for each of her children.* She wouldn't tell him about the others' plans, but each one was following the path she laid out. They're exactly where she planned them to be.

Futures lets Dark finish Zion.

**THE ENDING:**

Dante awakens — healed by Dark's Mist. Not perfectly, but enough.

They decide to split up:
- **Dark** goes to Kilson to find Sophia
- **Futures and Dante** head to Solamina to find Astra

The last scene of Book 1: **Dark and Futures shake hands.**

The family is on its way back together.
