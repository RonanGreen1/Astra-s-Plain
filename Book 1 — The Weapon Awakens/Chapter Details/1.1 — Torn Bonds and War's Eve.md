# Chapter 1.1 — Torn Bonds and War's Eve

## Purpose
This is the reader's first impression of the entire world. Everything in this chapter is designed to **set an expectation and then quietly subvert it**. The opening scene drips with classical divine grandeur — white marble, golden trim, towering pillars — so that when we cut to the family home, the reader is caught off guard by how *human* it looks. That dissonance is the point. These gods are people. Their world is not what you assumed. This tension runs through the entire series.

---

## Scene 1 — The Circle of Ten (Council Chamber)

### Setting


The council chamber of the Circle of Ten. This room is the reader's first visual of the world, and it must feel like the **most stereotypically "Greek god" space imaginable** — because the story will spend the rest of its run dismantling that assumption.

**The Room:**
- A vast, cavernous hall built from **white Angelic Marble**, polished to a mirror sheen
- The floor is a single unbroken expanse of marble, veined with faint gold
- **Massive pillars** line the walls, so thick that two people couldn't wrap their arms around one, rising to an **obscenely high ceiling** that disappears into soft light above — the kind of height that makes voices echo and people feel small
- The light source is ambient — no torches, no chandeliers. The marble itself seems to glow faintly, as if the room is lit from within
- **White marble chairs with golden trim** are arranged around a **long white marble table**, also gold-trimmed. The chairs are high-backed and imposing, carved with subtle angelic motifs
- The overall effect: regal, cold, and impersonal. This is a room built for authority, not comfort

> **Writer's Note:** Lean *hard* into the classical grandeur here. Readers should picture Zeus's court, Olympus, the Pantheon. That's deliberate — the story wants to weaponise that assumption so the shift to the family home hits harder.

### The Seating Arrangement

The table has a clear head position. Numbering clockwise from the head:

| Seat | God | Notes |
|------|-----|-------|
| **1 (Head)** | **Qazar** | Chairs the meeting. Smug, confident, in complete control. |
| **2 (Left of head)** | **Nova** | Not described or shown in detail. Her name is used later as a veiled threat. |
| **3** | **Horizon** | Present but not featured in this scene. |
| **4** | **Jupiter** | Directly opposite side from Sforza. Loud, hostile, confrontational. |
| **5** | **Ray** | Votes no. Quiet in this scene. |
| **6** | **Sforza** | The emotional centre of this scene. Desperate, fierce, barely controlled. |
| **7** | **Dimitri** | Beside Sforza. Steady, supportive. His hand finds her leg under the table. |
| **8** | **Elemental** | Present but not featured. |
| **9** | **Eana** | Present but not featured. |
| **10 (Right of head)** | **Miiac** | Votes no. Not featured beyond his vote. |

### The Scene — Beat by Beat

**Opening:**
The scene opens mid-debate. The ten gods are already arguing. The reader should feel dropped into the middle of something that has been going on for a while — raised voices, tension that's been building. We see only the four key players in any detail: **Qazar, Jupiter, Sforza, and Dimitri**. The other six are present but are shapes in chairs, background figures. We know there are ten because the room has ten seats, but the focus is laser-tight.

**Qazar** is at the head of the table. He has an air of **smug confidence** — not the noble, wise authority a reader might expect from a god-king. He's enjoying this. He likes watching the others argue. This is the **first crack in the grandeur** — the leader of the gods is not a benevolent patriarch. He's a man who likes power and likes watching people squirm under it.

**Sforza rises to her feet.** She **slams her palm on the marble table** — the sound cracks through the hall like a whip. The room goes quiet. She delivers a desperate, impassioned plea to keep the gods out of the war. Her argument is strategic, not emotional (though emotion bleeds through):

> *Suggested dialogue direction — Sforza's plea:*
> - "You cannot rule an empire that you've destroyed through your own goddamn naivety!"
> - She argues that gods and devils have **always** stayed off the frontlines for a reason — when beings of their power fight directly, the destruction is **catastrophic**. Cities don't just fall — they're erased. Landscapes are reshaped. Civilian casualties become measured in entire populations, not numbers.
> - "Every time a god has set foot on a battlefield, the land itself has had to be abandoned for centuries. Do you want to win a war and inherit ashes?"
> - "We are losing, yes — but we lose *more* by turning their world into a graveyard. We're supposed to be protecting them, not using them as a stage for our egos."
> - Her final line should land like a verdict: something that makes the room uncomfortable because she's *right*, and everyone knows it.

**This establishes Sforza's character immediately:** she is not soft. She doesn't like not being in control. But first and foremost, she cares about people's lives. She sees the bigger picture. She's the smartest person in the room, and she knows it — but that doesn't mean anyone will listen to her.

**Jupiter stands.** He's on the **opposite side of the table** (seat 4). He stands **laughing** — not a polite chuckle but a loud, boisterous, deliberately dismissive laugh. He is openly hostile. He doesn't argue Sforza's points — he attacks *her*:

> *Suggested dialogue direction — Jupiter's retort:*
> - He calls her a "useless puppeteer" — a direct jab at her Mist abilities, implying she's all manipulation and no substance
> - Something about her "quick mouth" being "useless in war" — reducing her strategic intelligence to nagging
> - He speaks as if she's beneath him. Not with anger, but with genuine contempt, like he's swatting a fly
> - His body language is big, expansive — arms wide, leaning back, taking up space. He wants everyone to see him dismissing her

**Qazar holds up his hand.** The room falls **instantly silent**. This is the most telling moment — the *speed* of that silence. Every god in this room, including Jupiter, obeys that hand without question. Qazar doesn't raise his voice. He doesn't need to.

**Small detail:** As the silence falls, show **Sforza's reaction** — her fingers tighten on the edge of the table, knuckles whitening against the marble. And beneath the table, unseen by anyone, **Dimitri's hand finds her leg** — a quiet, steady pressure. Not restraining her. Supporting her. Two people who communicate without words because they've been partners for centuries.

**Qazar speaks.** His retort is **half-hearted and dismissive** — he doesn't engage with Sforza's argument because he doesn't respect it enough to. He makes a vague appeal to duty:

> *Suggested dialogue direction — Qazar:*
> - Something about how retreat would lose them the respect of both enemies and subjects
> - He invokes the Almighty One — "We must uphold the values bestowed upon us" — but it rings hollow, performative. He's using scripture as a gavel, not a compass.
> - The subtext: Qazar doesn't care about the argument. The decision was made before anyone sat down. This meeting is theatre.

**The Vote.** Qazar puts it to a formal vote.

| Vote | Gods |
|------|------|
| **No** (against fighting) | Miiac, Dimitri, Sforza, Ray |
| **Yes** (fight on the frontlines) | Qazar, Nova, Horizon, Jupiter, Elemental, Eana |

**Result: 6–4.** The gods will fight.

**The aftermath:** Thin **tendrils of mist** begin rising from Sforza's body — her power responding to her fury. It's involuntary, a sign of how close she is to losing control. **Every god at the table notices.** The mist is not threatening yet — it's a warning sign, like the first wisps of smoke before a fire. The room tenses.

**Dimitri stands immediately** — reading the room, reading his wife, knowing they need to leave before this escalates. He addresses Qazar directly, his voice calm and controlled:

> "I'm assuming that's everything."

Qazar doesn't let them leave. He looks at Dimitri with that **taunting, smug grin** — he's been waiting for this moment. He shakes his head slowly:

> "Since you're so eager to leave… why don't you two go help on the frontlines first? Show our troops their gods are there beside them."

**The table reacts.** Shock. This isn't just a vote — it's a punishment. Qazar is sending Sforza and Dimitri specifically because Sforza opposed him. Everyone knows it. Nobody says anything.

The marble **cracks under Sforza's grip** on the table. Her fingers have dug into the stone itself. The mist thickens. She doesn't speak. She doesn't move.

Then Qazar says one word — **"Nova."**

He doesn't look at Nova. He doesn't need to. The name hangs in the air, and everyone understands what it means: *if they do anything, kill them.* Nova is the unspoken enforcement. The blade behind the throne.

> **Writer's Note:** Do NOT describe Nova in this scene. Don't show her reaction, her face, her body language. She is a name and a threat. That's all the reader gets. The mystery is the point.

Sforza and Dimitri leave.

## Scene 2 — Training in the Garden (The Family Home — Exterior)

### Setting — The House and Grounds

This is the reader's **first look at where the family actually lives**, and it must feel like a deliberate contrast to the marble grandeur of the council chamber.

**The Grounds:**
- The house sits in the **dead centre of an enormous field** — a vast, flat plain of **golden straw-coloured grass** that stretches to the horizon in every direction. No roads, no fences, no neighbouring structures. Just endless golden grass beneath a sky that isn't quite right
- **The sky** has a faint **pinkish hue** — not aggressively alien, just subtly *off*. The clouds seem **impossibly high**, like they're painted on a ceiling miles above, drifting at a scale that makes everything feel small
- There is no path to this house. No address. This is **Sforza's domain** — her personal territory within the Godly Realm. She has been here so long that **mist is woven into the very life cycle of the earth around her**. The grass grows because of her. She can feel anyone who steps on it, like nerve endings in her skin. But the field itself is natural — it is not generated by her mist. It is a genuinely flat plain of golden grass that existed before her, and she has simply become part of it

**The House:**
- **Grand but practical** — think a **19th-century estate house** in style. Not a palace, not a castle, but unmistakably the home of someone powerful. Two or three storeys, with elegant proportions, high ceilings, and fine detailing — but it's a *home*, not a government building
- Built from **warm pale stone** (stone, with the kind of smooth, heavy blocks that suggest age and permanence) with **darker stone accents** around the windows, doorframes, and cornerstones
- **Large round windows** on each side of the upper floor — each of the family's bedrooms faces one of the **four cardinal directions** (North, South, East, West). Sforza and Dimitri's bedroom faces the direction where Futures will later collapse — she can see it from her window
- Architectural details: a **solid front door** (dark wood, iron fittings), **stone steps** leading to a modest porch, **tall chimneys** (whether functional or decorative is unclear), and **climbing ivy or vine-like plants** on one side. The house feels *lived in* — not pristine, not crumbling, just comfortable
- The overall effect: a house that says "wealthy family" but not "divine being." It could be a countryside manor in 19th-century England if not for the pink sky and golden grass

> **Writer's Note — Why the house looks like this:** Sforza built this home deliberately to resemble a human dwelling. She used Miiac's power — controlling him with her mist, she accessed his ability to see the past, present, and future (though not alternate timelines). Through his visions, she saw human architecture and modelled the house after it. This was part of her larger plan: she knew her children would eventually end up in the Terra Realm (the human world), and she wanted them to grow up in an environment that would make the transition feel less alien. Miiac warned her that looking into his visions was a curse. She looked anyway. (This mirrors what she later does with Astra — reading him, regardless of the cost. The reason for the modern aspect is she simply didnt like how the houses of her time looked. the architecture in their society was farm more advanced so she did have taste and standards.)

**The Garden (Training Area):**
- The sparring happens on the **golden grass** behind the house — the same straw-coloured grass that covers the entire plain. It's tough, springy stuff, good for rolling and falling on
- A **stone counter or outdoor table** sits near the back of the house with a **glass of water** on it — the kids grab a drink after training
- **Possible tree suggestions:** Given the alien-but-grounded aesthetic, consider:
  - A single **large tree with pale bark and golden-amber leaves** — matching the grass, like the whole landscape is one colour palette. Broad canopy, good for shade
  - Alternatively, a **silver-barked tree with deep blue-violet leaves** — standing out against the gold as the one splash of different colour in the entire landscape
  - Or a **gnarled, ancient-looking tree with no leaves at all** — just pale, twisting branches reaching upward like hands, suggesting the tree is as old as Sforza's time here
  - The tree doesn't carry plot significance — it's set dressing. Pick whichever feels most atmospheric

### The Sparring — Beat by Beat

**Futures** is roughly **30 god-years old**, which equates to roughly a **10-year-old human** physically and mentally.

> **Age Ratio Note for the Writer:** Gods and humans are born at the same developmental stage, but gods age approximately **three times slower** than humans. So at age 3, a god has the physical and mental development of a 1-year-old human. However, this ratio is not perfectly linear — it's **slightly exponential**, meaning the gap widens as they age. A 30-year-old god is roughly a 10-year-old human. A 70-year-old god is roughly a **23-year-old human**. A 100-year-old god might only be equivalent to a 28-year-old. The older they get, the slower they age relative to humans.

**Sophia** is roughly **70 god-years old**, equating to roughly a **23-year-old human** physically.

**The fight:**
- Futures is **scrappy and talented for his age**. He has active use of his **lightning** (blue-tinted, due to Sforza's blood — faint remnants of her mist energy unconsciously colour his power). He is clearly quick, not clumsy, and shows genuine combat instincts. But he is **brash and reckless** — he commits too hard to attacks, overextends, leaves himself open
- Sophia is in complete control. She's **giggling, taunting** — deliberately provoking him. She's light on her feet, doing **twirls and spins** and leaving **trails of mist** behind her for dramatic flair. She's showing off, and she knows it
- The finishing move: Sophia controls her mist into a **dense fist shape**, using her own body as a visual wall so Futures can't see it forming behind her. When he dodges what he *thinks* is her attack, the **fist of mist cracks him across the jaw** from his blind side
- The moment it connects, **the giggle and the overly feminine theatrics drop instantly**. Sophia bursts out **genuinely laughing** — a real, uncontrolled laugh, not the performative one. The mask comes off and she's just a sister who got her little brother good
- Futures sits up looking **genuinely angry** — not playful-angry, actually frustrated. Sophia's face **softens immediately**. She walks over, crouches down to his level, rubs his head, and tells him he did well. The shift from teasing rival to caring sister is instant and genuine

**The Interruption:**
Just as they're grabbing water from the glass on the counter, they hear what sounds like **arguing** coming from inside the house. Then **Dimitri and Sforza enter** — they've just arrived home.

> **Important detail — the arrival:** Before Dimitri and Sforza walked through the door, Futures and Sophia heard a **loud bang** from the distance. This was **Dimitri arriving at speed** — his movement is so fast it creates a **crack of lightning and a thunderclap**, like a sonic boom. Dimitri's lightning is **yellow** (natural, from his own power). The bang left a **massive scorch mark** on the grass outside — a charred circle burned into the golden field. This scorch mark becomes important at the end of the chapter.

The parents clearly **quiet their argument** as they enter, shifting to neutral expressions. They walk into the kitchen. Futures and Sophia exchange a look — they know something is wrong but say nothing.

---

## Scene 3 — The Kitchen and Dinner

### Setting — The Kitchen

Another deliberate subversion of expectations. The kitchen looks **remarkably human**:

- Countertops, a cooking area, a sink or basin, shelves with containers
- Not futuristic, not magical — functional and domestic
- It should feel like a kitchen the reader could walk into, aside from the round window showing a pink sky and endless golden grass outside

> **Writer's Note:** The human look of the house is Sforza's design. She studied human homes through Miiac's visions and replicated the layout. Not perfectly — there are small oddities that a human would notice (proportions slightly off, materials that don't quite match any Earth stone, the round windows) — but the *intent* is clearly to mimic human domesticity.

### Dinner — Beat by Beat

**Sforza cooked.** She is a perfectly competent cook — there's nothing clumsy or uncertain about how she prepares the meal. The issue isn't her ability; it's the *ingredients*. Despite building a human-style house and modelling their domestic life after what she saw in Miiac's visions, Sforza still lives in the Godly Realm. The produce, the livestock, the raw materials — they're all from here. She can mimic the shape of a human life, but she can't change what grows in divine soil. The result is a meal that *looks* almost familiar but is unmistakably not from any world the reader knows.

**The Meal:**
- **Eggs** — a familiar shape, but the shells are a **pale yellow** and when cracked, the yolks are a **soft pink**. Cooked cleanly — scrambled or fried with confidence — but the colour is uncanny no matter how well they're prepared
- **A vegetable** — resembles **celery** in shape (long, pale stalks) but is **pure white** with **grey speckled spots** along the surface, like freckles. The texture is crunchier than celery, almost crystalline when bitten
- **Something like a sausage** — a **greyish-white, slightly flappy thing** shaped roughly like the letter **T**. It sits on top of the plate like a garnish no one asked for. The texture is somewhere between meat and mushroom, and it has a faintly sweet, gamey smell
- **Boar meat** — from a boar native to the Godly Realm. This is the most recognisable item on the plate. It looks and tastes roughly like the boar meat a human would know, though perhaps slightly richer, slightly purple-tinted in the grain

> **Writer's Note:** The food is the quiet limit of Sforza's plan. She built a human house, modelled a human routine, even learned to cook by watching humans through Miiac's visions — but she can't change what the Godly Realm *is*. The ingredients are divine, alien, unmistakably not-Earth. For the family, this is completely normal — they don't notice anything strange. For the reader, it's another reminder: the house may look human, but the world it sits in is not. Sforza can simulate the shape of human life, but she can't replicate it entirely. Not yet.

**At the table:**
- The family sits down. It's **quiet** — the tension from the argument the parents were having bleeds into the meal. No one is talking freely
- **Sophia's eyes flicker** — a brief, involuntary reaction. It's not that she's seen something or sensed something with her powers — it's pure **emotional awareness**. She knows her parents. She knows what their silence sounds like. She can feel the weight of something unsaid hanging over the table. But she **says nothing** because she doesn't want to bring it up in front of Futures. She's protecting him from it for as long as she can
- Sforza breaks the silence. She addresses both children directly and tells them: **she and Dimitri are joining the war.**

### The Argument — Beat by Beat

**Context for the reader:** Futures and Sophia are not prisoners in the house. They can leave. But they've been told directly *why* it's dangerous to venture outside the boundaries of Sforza's domain — their parents are powerful gods with enemies, and that makes the children **valuable targets**. Kidnapping, leverage, assassination. The children stay within the golden field because they understand the threat, not because they're locked in.

**Sophia's reaction:**
- An argument erupts between Sophia and the parents. Sophia is **sharp, strategic, and increasingly frustrated**
- Her eyes **sting with unshed tears** — not sadness, but **frustration**. She's trying to make them understand, trying to get through to them, and they won't listen
- She doesn't attack emotionally — she attacks logically. She **references Qazar directly**:
  > *Suggested dialogue direction — Sophia:*
  > - "You're not just putting yourselves in danger — you're putting *everyone* in danger. You know what Qazar is. You know what he's like."
  > - "He's not sending you because you're needed. He's sending you because you *opposed* him. This is punishment dressed as duty."
  > - "And when you're gone — when you're out there dying for his ego — what happens to us? What happens to every person counting on you to keep Qazar in check?"
  > - "You're the only ones who push back. If you're gone, he has *no opposition*. Is that what you want?"
- Sophia doesn't cry. The tears stay right at the edge, burning, but she refuses to let them fall. This is a girl who will not give anyone — not even her parents — the satisfaction of seeing her break

**Futures' reaction:**
- Futures **stands.** His eyes widen with understanding — the full weight of it landing on him all at once. He's 10 years old in human terms, and he just understood that his parents might die
- He mutters: *"You can't…"*
- He looks at Sophia — **as if she could do something**, as if his big sister could fix this the way she fixes everything
- She can't. And he sees it in her face
- He **turns and runs outside**. He throws a **lightning bolt** into the distance — it crashes into the field with a deafening crack. Then another. And another. He's **slamming lightning into the ground over and over**, scorching the golden grass, each bolt a scream he can't articulate
- Eventually he stops. He sits. Then he lies down in the field, staring up at the pink sky, spent and empty

> **Detail:** Futures is unconsciously slamming his lightning into the **same spot** that Dimitri's arrival scorched earlier. His blue bolts hitting the same earth his father's yellow lightning burned. The charred circle Futures creates is **not even a third the size** of the one Dimitri left by simply *moving*. The difference in scale silently tells the reader everything about the gap between a child's power and a god's.

---

## Scene 4 — Sforza and Dimitri Alone (The Bedroom)

### Setting — The Master Bedroom

- Sforza and Dimitri's room is on the upper floor, facing the direction where Futures now lies in the field
- A **large round window** dominates one wall, offering a wide view of the golden plain. Through it, Sforza can see Futures lying in the grass and, eventually, Sophia walking out to him
- The room is **grand but personal** — fine furniture, a large bed, heavy curtains that frame the round window, a writing desk. The 19th-century estate aesthetic continues — dark wood, upholstered chairs, a quality that speaks to taste rather than excess

### The Conversation — Beat by Beat

**Dimitri's position:** He's coming from a place of **scepticism but trust**. He doesn't fully understand Sforza's plan. He has doubts. But he trusts her — not blindly, but with the earned faith of someone who has watched her be right too many times to dismiss.

**Sforza is standing at the window**, watching Futures lie in the grass. She watches Sophia leave the house and begin walking toward him. Her face is unreadable.

**She doubles down.** She acknowledges Dimitri's concerns — she doesn't dismiss them. But she says, with quiet certainty:

> "It can't happen any other way." "It's almost time."

**What "it's almost time" means:**
Sforza is referring specifically to the **move to the Terra Realm** — the moment that sets everything in motion. She stole Miiac's memories by controlling him with her Mist. He warned her it was a curse — she looked anyway. Through those memories, she has seen the chain of events that begins with their exile: the escape to the Terra Realm, the birth and loss of Astra, the suffering her children will endure, and the cascade that eventually ends with the **death of the Almighty One**. The Terra Realm is the catalyst. Once they leave the Godly Realm, the dominoes begin to fall — and they don't stop until the creator of the universe is dead.

Sforza loves her children. Ferociously, unconditionally. But she also knows — from what she has seen — that **they will survive**. The pain they are about to face is not unnecessary. It is the price of something greater.

There is a specific sadness in this scene: **the grief of a parent who knows what's coming**. She knows about her own death. She knows Sophia will lose Astra. She knows Futures will struggle. She knows Dark will be born broken. And she can't stop any of it, because stopping it means the larger plan fails.

> **Writer's Note — Sforza and Ray:** Sforza and Ray are similar in many ways — both are "good," both see the bigger picture, both are willing to sacrifice. But their goals diverge: **Ray wants to end the Holy War.** **Sforza wants to kill the Almighty One** — she blames him for everything: the suffering, the death of people she's cared for, the broken system he created and abandoned. Ray doesn't know that Sforza shares similar knowledge (from Miiac's memories), but they get along because they sense they're on the same page. They're allies who don't fully trust each other with the truth.

**The emotional note to land:**
Despite the scheming, despite the manipulation, despite the centuries-long plan — show that **Dimitri and Sforza genuinely love their children**. This isn't a cold strategist sacrificing pawns. This is a mother who has to watch her children suffer because she has seen a future where that suffering leads to something that matters. The pain is real. The love is real. The plan is necessary. All three of those things are true at the same time.

---

## Scene 5 — Sophia and Futures in the Field

### Setting

Outside. The golden field. A light rain has started — it was barely a trickle when this scene begins but grows steadily throughout the conversation. The pink sky is muted behind grey clouds. Futures is lying in the scorched grass. The charred marks from his lightning surround him.

### The Conversation — Beat by Beat

Sophia arrives at Futures. She doesn't stand over him — she **sits down beside him**, not looking at him directly. She **leans back on her hands**, tilting her head up to look at the sky. Giving him space. Not forcing it.

She **probes cautiously** — testing to see if he wants to talk. Futures catches it immediately (he knows his sister). They begin talking.

**The tone:** This should be a **surprisingly mature conversation** — but one that still shows Futures' age. The dynamic is unexpected: it's **almost Futures doing the consoling**, in his own way. He says things that are simple and direct in a way that cuts through Sophia's overthinking:

> *Suggested dialogue direction — examples of Futures' simplicity cutting through:*
> - Sophia is spiralling about strategy and Qazar and what happens next, and Futures just says: "They'll come back. Mum said so." And Sophia stops, because she realises she hasn't even considered *believing* the promise — she went straight to planning for its failure.
> - Sophia says something about how they need to be ready for the worst, and Futures says: "Ready for what? We're kids." And there's a silence, because he's right — they shouldn't have to be ready for anything.
> - Futures says something like: "If they don't come back, I'll go get them." Said with total seriousness, total conviction, and total 10-year-old inability to understand what that would actually mean. Sophia **smiles to herself** — not patronising, not sad, just… a small, private smile at how simple and fierce he is.
> - Something about Sophia realising she's been so busy trying to be the adult that she forgot her little brother doesn't need an adult right now — he needs a sister

**Key beat:** Futures is not naive. He understood what the dinner announcement meant. He's not in denial. He's just processing it with the emotional tools of a child — which, in this case, means more directly and more honestly than Sophia is managing with her adult tools.

---

## Scene 6 — The Departure (The Letter)

### Beat by Beat

The conversation is interrupted by another **loud bang** — the same thunderclap they heard earlier. Dimitri's departure. Another sonic boom of yellow lightning.

The rain, which had been building throughout the conversation, is now **fully falling** — heavy, steady rain soaking the golden grass.

Sophia tells Futures they should head inside. He agrees. They run to the house, splashing through the increasingly damp field.

Inside, they find a **note on the table**. From Sforza:

> *"I'm sorry, children. We will be back — I promise. I know you are angry. We just need you to trust us. We love you so much."*

> **Writer's Note:** Sforza left a note instead of saying goodbye in person deliberately. This was not cowardice — it was **engineering**. She is strengthening the bond between Futures and Sophia by creating moments where they only have each other. Not just shared sadness, but shared *anger*. She's forging them in the fire of abandonment because she knows what's coming and she knows they'll need each other more than they'll need her.

### Futures' Breakdown

Futures **runs outside**. The rain is now flashing with **thunder and lightning** — a storm fully unleashed, the sky cracking open.

He runs toward the scorch mark — the massive one left by Dimitri's departure. He **trips** on the increasingly slick, damp grass. Gets up. Trips again. Keeps going, stumbling and sliding, until he **collapses to his knees** at the edge of the enormous charred circle.

Small **puddles are already forming** in the scorch mark — rain collecting in the burned depression of the earth.

Futures lets out a **child's scream** — not a battle cry, not a roar, but the raw, uncontrolled scream of a child in pain. Anger and grief and helplessness all in one sound. It echoes across the empty golden field with no one to hear it but the rain.

### Sophia's Arrival

Sophia has just arrived outside. She **hesitates** at the doorway or the edge of the house.

Lightning from the storm illuminates the scene in flashes — her brother, on his knees, small and soaked and broken, in the middle of a scorch mark their father left by simply *moving*.

She has to **swallow the sickness she feels**. The coldness growing inside her — not indifference, but the defensive numbness of someone watching something they can't fix. This is the first time Sophia has to *choose* to be strong instead of *being* strong. She is not okay. She swallows it anyway.

She walks to him. Crouches down. Puts her hand on his shoulder. Then she **pulls him into a hug**, his face pressed against her, both of them soaked through.

Sophia stares over his head at the **damp scorch mark** where small puddles have formed in the charred earth — the last trace of their parents, already being washed away by the rain.

**Hold on that image.** The chapter ends.

---

## Thematic Summary

| Theme | How It Appears |
|-------|---------------|
| **Subverted grandeur** | Marble council chamber vs. human-looking home. Gods who argue like politicians, live like families. |
| **Power vs. powerlessness** | Sforza is one of the most powerful beings alive, and she can't stop a vote. Futures can throw lightning, and he can't make his parents stay. |
| **Sforza's dual nature** | She is simultaneously a loving mother and a ruthless long-term strategist. Both are real. Neither cancels the other. |
| **The gap between generations** | Dimitri's yellow scorch mark vs. Futures' blue one — a third the size. The child is powerful. The parent is on another level entirely. |
| **Rain as emotional currency** | The rain starts as a trickle during the calm conversation and becomes a storm during the breakdown. It washes away the scorch mark — the last physical trace of the parents. |
